    given a string that has (usually) two pieces of information in it,
    break it up into the two pieces (defaultng to None for max one of them).

    we try not to be overly sentimental re: ourobouros center-of-the-universe
    spots, but if there was one it would be the part where we try to write a
    regex to parse all the various version expressions and date strings of a
    collection of parser generators ðŸ‘¹

    broad provisions:
      - we never have to check for empty string or blank string.
      - which is to say there is always some "content" to parse.

    heuristically:
      - if it has a date:
        - it's always anchored to the end
        - it's always of the psuedo format ' ?MM?/YYYY$'
        - which is to say always the month, never the day.
        - a date may appear alone or it may appear after a version expression.
        - there's the separator space IFF preceding version expression.
      - if it has a version expression:
        - circa one version expression doesn't have any periods
        - circa one version expression doesn't begin with a '^v ?'
        - if you strip out the any leading '^v ?' and any interceding periods,
          all version expressions are '^[0-9a-z]+'

    corollaries of all the above:
      - it has a date IFF it contains '/'. (it will have at most one).
      - after you lop off the any date matched by above (and any separator
        space), the any remaining head-anchored content is the version
        expression
      - we may simply want to normalize
