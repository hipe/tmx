(Right now just viz of a UI user flow graph)
(And crazy routing experiment)
(Now it's a catch-all for web-based tooling)


# Wishlist/itches

+ Imagine the several things you could do with routes
  + (moved off stack #history-C.1)
  + Every endpoint has a route string and a function. You could use the name
    of the function to identify uniquely the route and produce a url from it
  + Within the definition of an endpoint you could link it to other endpoints
    (i.e. define the app graph)
+ You could do the "analogs" project. (Moved off stack #history-C.1.)
