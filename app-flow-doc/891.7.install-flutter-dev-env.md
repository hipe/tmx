# Installing flutter on our linux

Followed [flutter doc][1flu] then [snap doc][2sna] then [snap doc][3sna]. Worked!


# Create new app!

```(bash)
$ flutter create dir_name
```


# Run it on chrome

(See "How we installed chrome on our linux" below.)

We googled "chrome flutter extension" which was WRONG.
We want "dart debug extension"



# How we installed chrome on our linux

Amusingly, this was more difficult than installing flutter.

We attempted installing some tools to attempt to build
aseprite and RPGMaker from source, for an adjacent project.
Some of those steps may be mixed in with step below.

Because of the above and because of how stochastic this all is,
we have not made an effort to clean up the below at the present time.

```(bash)
s a i autoconf (to get autoreconf)
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
googled 'install chrome on ubuntu'
https://itsfoss.com/install-chrome-ubuntu/
above didn't work, ran into dependency problem. trying this:
https://www.fosslinux.com/41355/how-to-install-chrome-and-chromium-browser-on-pop_os.htm
above failed, try this: https://linuxhint.com/install-google-chrome-pop-os/
sudo apt-get install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
the above failed because unmet dependency, but we followed what the
response error message said to try, which was:
sudo apt --fix-broken install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
go to chrome://version in chrome to find the chrome executable
```
