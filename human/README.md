# the skylab "human" sidesystem

## objective & scope

this library is focused on concerns that approach "human compuer
interaction" from the other direction: this library attempts to help the
machine talk (textually) like a human. there is no strong AI here, no
deep learning, just some hacks..




## deeper

albeit facile, this library has a few idea it tries to prototype that
we hope are at least somewhat novel [#034].
