# expression strategy design patterns :[#044]

## intro

this is riffing off of something that lead to the closely related effort
at [#034] "expression frames", and probably whatever was intended by its
related [#039] "reduce frames algorithm"..

but this is a fresh take on this old idea..




## "vectors" (axes?) of design

we see these "vectors" as sort of like fundamental forces of this space,
perhaps as fundamental as gravity and electromagnetism are in the
physical space.

we will flesh this out later,  but for now we will say it's things like

  • coherence - does the expresssion make sense? how much sense does it
    make?

  • relevance - is the expression valuable ("meaningful") to me?

  • relevance density - a continous rather than discrete for of the above -
      how valuable this expression to me?

  • detail - probably related to above..

(etc the above is just a sketch). consider also: ambiguity, strange or
non-idiomatic construction, ...




## brevity & terse-ness versus verbosity & detail

(etc)

## the inverse pyramid as a stragegy for relevance density.  :[#]:1
