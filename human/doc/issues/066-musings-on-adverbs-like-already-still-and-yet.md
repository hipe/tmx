# musings on adverbs like already, still and yet :[#066]

(this article is a (lengthy) "stub" to complement a discussion over in
[ac], tagged with subject.)

the use of a seemingly simple adverb like "already" can in fact express
a subtlety that is the product of a relatively complex calculation of
(in this model) four variables.

these four variables, in turn, are a sort of permutation across *three*
"dimensions"; one being *time* (collapsed down to "then" and and "now"),
another being whether a given measurable boolean characteristic is
*affirmative* or *negative*, and the final being the dimension of
"expectation", which is to say that you can model both that which is
*expected* and that which (supposedly) *is*.

this is entirely impossible to understand without examples. in fact
all of the theory presented here is back-derived from "real" expressions
that we then go back and try to explain..

let's take our favorite example of having an umbrella. I'm going to say
to you whether or not I have an umbrella. but the adjectives I use (if
any) can be used to imply (or infer, if you're the listener) details along
the axes we are presenting (that is, the intersection of time, fact and
expectation).

in the below table, let the columns A, B, C and D mean the following:

A) is whether I was (and still am) expected to have had an umbrella in the past.

B) is whether I am expected to have an umbrella now.

C) is whether I *did* have an umbrella in the past.

D) is whether I *do* have an umbrella now.

so this should be interesting, shouldn't it!?

(we have written this much without knowing what the results will be,
only that we have 16 permutations to consider.)


    |   A |   B |   C |   D | then
    | yes | yes | yes | yes |  (no change in state, no contrasts. say nothing.) (1)
    | yes | yes | yes |  no |  "I don't have the umbrella any more" / "I don't have it now" / "i no longer have it" (2)
    | yes | yes |  no | yes |  "Now I have the umbrella" (3)
    | yes | yes |  no |  no | ~"I've never had the umbrella" (4)
    | yes |  no | yes | yes |  "I still have the umbrella" (5)
    | yes |  no | yes |  no |  (no difference from what is expected. say nothing.) (6)
    | yes |  no |  no | yes | ~"[actually,] I have the umbrella *now*" (7)
    | yes |  no |  no |  no |  "I never had the umbrella in the first place" (8)
    |  no | yes | yes | yes | ~"I already have an umbrella" / "I've always had the umbrella" (9)
    |  no | yes | yes |  no | ~"[actually,] I had it before but I don't have it now" (10)
    |  no | yes |  no | yes |  (no difference from what is expected. say nothing.) (11)
    |  no | yes |  no |  no |  "I don't have the umbrella yet" / "I *still* don't have it" (12)
    |  no |  no | yes | yes |  "I have the umbrella"/"I have always had the umbrella" (13)
    |  no |  no | yes |  no |  "[actually,] I had the umbrella before (but not now)" (14)
    |  no |  no |  no | yes | ~"I just got an umbrella [now]" (15)
    |  no |  no |  no |  no |  (no difference from what is expected, say nothing.) (16)



the above looks complicated (and indeed, it is) but maybe we can derive
something useful while still trying to reduce the number of moving parts:




## approaching a meta-model, one phenomenon at a time

### when to use `still`

as a rule, it seems that "still" has at least this precondition:

  - the condition that *is* must match the condition that *was*.
    (that is, in the modeled *reality* there must be no state change.)

so, namely that means either "yes", "yes" or "no", "no" for columns
(C) and (D).

and also there is one more precodition we would like to posit; but to
get there we want to take an essential detour:

using some observed (and theoretic) axioms, we can derive some further
corollaries of its use (and perhaps begin to develop an analytic model):

our first axiom seems to be this:

  - when the expected "story" matches the actual "story", there is
    probably no value in stating that fact. i.e, don't say anything
    in these cases unless asked.

(this probably ties into one of our other axiomatic observations mentioned
elsewhere in this sidesystem.

so let's back up and consider our 16 permutations, and see if we can
reduce these down to a smaller set of permutations (rows) that are
candidates for exercising the use of the expression "still".

given our first precondition offered at the beginning of the section,
this reduces the 16 down to 8. (really it's a permutation of the two
"reality" columns, so it's those rows for which column (C) and (D)
are either "yes", "yes" or "no", "no".

but we can further reduce these 8 by our "first axiom", that we don't
bother expressing things when reality matches expectation. this means
that of our remaining 8:

    |   A |   B |   C |   D | then
    | yes | yes | yes | yes | 1
    | yes | yes |  no |  no | 4
    | yes |  no | yes | yes | 5
    | yes |  no |  no |  no | 8
    |  no | yes | yes | yes | 9
    |  no | yes |  no |  no | 12
    |  no |  no | yes | yes | 13
    |  no |  no |  no |  no | 16


we can eliminate from consideration rows where the (A, B) tuple
id identical to the (C, D) tuple (case (1) and case (16)):

    |   A |   B |   C |   D | then
    | yes | yes |  no |  no | 4
    | yes |  no | yes | yes | 5
    | yes |  no |  no |  no | 8
    |  no | yes | yes | yes | 9
    |  no | yes |  no |  no | 12
    |  no |  no | yes | yes | 13

this alone doesn't quite reach the set of rows we seem to be after.
(but note this technique *has* eliminated rows we wanted to eliminate.)

so let's futher theorize that maybe "still" is useful for when change
was expected but in the reality there was no change. so we'll eliminate
those rows whose *expectation* modeled no change. the following are the
only rows that match all the above criteria and have expectations that
modeled a story with change:

    |   A |   B |   C |   D | then
    | yes |  no | yes | yes | 5
    | yes |  no |  no |  no | 8
    |  no | yes | yes | yes | 9
    |  no | yes |  no |  no | 12

row (5) is like our quintessential use case for the word "still", so it's
good that that's there. but row (8) doesn't sound right using "still".
neither does row (9). row (12) has an association to "still" of moderate
strength (but there is pull to use "yet" there, which we'll discuss below.)

but let's focus the question to this: what do (8) and (9) have that we
can use to disqualify them definitively from consideration? the answer
is that their (B) value matches their (D) value; that is, that the
"reality stories" "landed on" being in accordance with the expected
stories. in such cases it seems that to use "still" sounds unnatural,
and in the remaining two cases, using "still" is at least acceptable
if not ideal.

so this is one (of certainly several) possible models for when we
can produce the adverb "still":

  - when the reality story differs from the expectation story
  - when there is no change in the reality from past to present (static reality story)
  - when the reality story did not "land on" the same value as the expectation story.

so that was fun! what next? we'll try to find another surface phenomenon
in the expression that looks the next most common.




## ponderance

aside from "still" (which we seem to have fully groked above), here's
a rough glimpse of some of the other surface phenomena we produced:
"any more", "now", "never", "actually", "in the first place", "already",
"always", "statement X but statement Y", "yet", [preterite], "just".

as you can see, these phenomena are almost as numerous as our permuations!
with this data set, the pragmatist would likely say that we should just
hard-code a table almost exactly as we have presented it (and in fact
we might do just that). but with that approach we don't come to any deeper
understanding of the phenomena we are trying to reproduce.




### "yet"

we know (we think) from spanish "ya" that "yet" is related to "still"
(or is it "already"?) (because in spanish, they are the same word, if
we have that right).

we suspect that "yet" is just a refinement on our "still" criteria,
but can be used only when the reality story lands on negative..

(that leaves only one permutation: (no yes no no), or case (12).





### "never"

  - it is safe to say that one precondition for "never" is that we have
    "no" "no" for columns (C) and (D). that is, it seems safe to say that
    we will .. er .. never use "never" for any permutations that do not
    match this criteria.

  - furthermore, it seems *acceptable* to use "never" for *all* cases
    that *do* match this same criteria. (in our examples we have some
    other phenomena for some of these cases, at which "never" gets
    "booted", perhaps for reasons we'll explore.) (spoiler: in our
    examples "never" gets booted by "yet" and by axiom 1.)




### "always" - maybe we never use it

it's tempting to say this is straightforward complement to never. and it
seems true that it is acceptable to use this phenomenon for all cases
with a postive static reality story (i.e all case for (yes yes) for
(C) and (D)).

but our focus on contrast with expectations (in concert with the other,
competing phenomena here) leads us to believe that this phenomenon gets
booted for all cases, period.


    (yes yes yes yes)  (no change in state, no contrasts. say nothing.) (1)
    (yes  no yes yes)  "I still have the umbrella" (5)
    ( no yes yes yes) ~"I already have an umbrella" / "I've always had the umbrella" (9)
    ( no  no yes yes)  "I have the umbrella"/"I have always had the umbrella" (13)


for (1) it seems awkardly redundant to add "always", even in confirmation.

for (5), "always" is acceptible but "still" seems better (because "still"
serves to contract with what is expected, rather than "always" which seems
to serve to emphasis the stasis *within* the reality story, and not between
the two stories.)

case (9) is like the quintessential case for "already", which boots the
subject.

for (13), if both stories are static then it seems redundant to add a
time dimension to them. (i.e if it is expected that you did not and
do not have an umbrella, then just saying that you have an umbrella
is probably enough.)




### "any more" ("no longer") ("now")

  - "any more" is a (perhaps colloquial and/or idiomatic) adverbial
    phrase that necessarily accompanies an expression which is *negative*
    in the *real* *present* (so, "no" for column D), but necessarily also
    also (in contrast to "yet"/"still") the reality must be a "change
    story", i.e to draw contrast from the real past (which is differnt).
    so that's necessarily "yes" "no" for (C) (D).

  - "no longer" seems a near isomorphic substitute for this; but note
    a) it sounds a bit more formal (or maybe Brit.) and b) this phenomenon
    serves (alone) to negate the statement, so !"I don't no longer have.."

  - note what we have said thus far doesn't take into account expectations
    ((A) and (B)).

  - it seems true to say that this phenomena can be fairly modeled as
    a subset of cases that qualify for use with "now". we can investigate
    further..

  - axiom 1 seems to trump this production. (it doens't seem appropriate
    to say "i don't have the umbrella *any more*" as a confirmation, if
    "yes" "no" (i.e the loss) is expected. but it is perhaps acceptable.)

  - axiom 2 ("landing on accordance") seems to eliminate this production
    too. if the negative is what is expected, "any more" seems uselessly
    to draw attention to the loss and sounds perhaps awkward.




### "now"

  - certainly one precondition for this seem to be a "change story"
    in the reality. ("I didn't; but now I do" and "I did, but now
    I don't.") (although we could imagine, "I didn't, and I still don't
    now." which seems like it is serving as an ancilliary emphatic,
    making the "still" more expressive.)




### "already"

this one seems easy but we can make it complicated. at first it seems
strongly to have only one case: if there's a positive static story in
the reality superimposed over positive change story for expectation,
so only (no yes yes yes).

but if we want a deeper understanding of it, we can play with it a bit:
if you take a photo negative of the above quad-tuple you get
(yes no no no). it would be *almost* acceptable (comprehensible, at
least) to say "I already didn't have the umbrella" here; although granted
it is a bit awkward. (we will revisit case (8) below).

anyway, if we accept our fanciful stretch of a second case above: what
was expected was a story of change, but the reality was a story of stasis
*that lands in accordance* with what was accepted. this last point is
essential.

to test this, we twiddle through all the other permuations with static
real stories that are outside of axiom 1:

    (yes  no yes yes) "I still have the umbrella" (5)
    ( yes no  no  no) "I never had the umbrella in the first place" (8)
    ( no yes  no  no) "I don't have the umbrella yet" / "I *still* don't have it" (12)
    ( no  no yes yes) "I have the umbrella" (13)

none of the above cases seem appropriate to exploit "already", under
any circumstances. so we are comfortable with the following:

  - reality differs from expected (axiom 1)
  - the reality story is static
  - the reality and expected stories land in accordance with each other
  - (weakly but still moderately), the reality story is positive.

IFF "yes" to the first three (and probably all four) of the above, then
this qualifies for using "already".




### "actually"

we had trouble finding a strong pattern for this one. we can target
2 of our 3 cases that suggest using this with this criteria:

  - the reality is a change story AND
  - the reality is entirely opposite the expected story.

(or you could say, when both are change stories and reality differs
from expectation.) we may revisit this at a later date.




### "in the first place"

this is the photo-negative of "already".

  - reality differs from expected (axiom 1)
  - reality and expected land in accordance with each other
  - reality is static
  - reality is negative



### "statement X but statement Y", [preterite]

from the suggested cases, this is a rough estimate:

when the reality is a "negating change story", it passes axiom 1,
and the past components don't accord (regardless of what happens
with the two present components) (so when "no" for (A)), there seems
to be a pull to want to state two statements explicitly.

so (  no yes yes  no ) (10) and
so (  no  no yes  no ) (14).

we could broaden this to include photo negatives,

    (yes yes  no yes)  "Now I have the umbrella" (3)
    (yes  no  no yes) ~"[actually,] I have the umbrella *now*" (7)

and it would be acceptible.
so maybe:
  - axiom 1
  - reality story is a change story
  - the two "past" components don't accord
  - (weakly) the reality lands negatively
