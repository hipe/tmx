# the conjuncter narrative :[#010]

## preface

yes, "conjuncter" is a cheeky neologism. I love lists, the oxford comma
and irony.




## introduction

if multiple phrases will be produced each of which is created simply
by connecting two ideas (e.g a verb and a noun) and there will be
repetition of the verb; for example phrases produced by this
pseudogrammar:

  { "including" | "excluding" } { A | B | .. },

this novelty :+[#hu-034] "expression frame"-like session will condense
the produced expressions down to fewer phrases and/or words, so the
multiple predicates (gerund phrases?) can be aggregated into one so
that instead of

  "including A"
  "including B"

we can say

  "including A and B"

or instead of

  "excluding A"
  "excluding B"

we can say

  "excluding A and B"

or instead of

  "including A"
  "excluding B"

we can cay

  "including A and excluding B"

etc.




## similarities to existing nodes

this is a sandbox of experimentation whose ultimate home is some
elsewhere.

  • it is very near #[#hu-055] aggregated articulation conceptually.

  • perhaps it belongs in the above mentioned box of expression frames.

  • it is the frontier driver of wishlist :+[#hu-041]
    conjuctive phrase logic, which perhaps me while overkilled by
    [#hu-053] the eventing articulator it uses.
    (EDIT: the above "sentence")




## features of implementation

  • this should have relatively low cost to use for clients that
    end up not expressing thru NLP because it builds the mutable
    phrase productions only on demand, not early.




## limitations

this won't do anything smart with "large" input constituencies.
