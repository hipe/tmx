/* discussion:
This document was created just for us to organize our strategy for
where to start with getting set up on a new machine..

It sort of relates to the nearby "timesheet".

Originally we had planned on "melting" the content in this document into
[#406] the "everything" graph (by retroactively inter-splicing activity
on that graph with the commits that relate to the nodes), so that we could
animate our efforts here in context with the big picture (and show it in
context with the bigger graph).

But now that we have gotten to the end of that effort, we realize that such
a retro-active melting would be superfluous and inelegant. But we couldn't
bring ourselves to just delete the document so here it is.)
