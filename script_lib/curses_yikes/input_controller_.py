"""
As far as we can forsee for now, the lifecycle of our clients will go
something like this:

    render the whole screen
    while True:
        block waiting for input

        if input didn't map to any known thing (was invalid)
            express a message about this (to flash)
            continue

        if input was a request to quit
            break

        given the valid input, dispatch [something] to the affected components
        (components themselves might soft error, later for that)
        (for now there's a 1-to-1 map b components affected and visual change)
        based on the components that changed, redraw those components


Design Objectives Overview

First, before we delve any deeper, it's worth mentioning now that
we attempt to write this in a way that is:

1. Fully decoupled from the curses lib (for now)
2. Fully exposed and decomposed for easy testing from the ground up


Component interactions general and specific

There are at least two kinds of .. components that this controller may have
close familiarity with in its interactions (but maybe not): the flash area
and the buttons area. The flash area will get written to "a lot" and the
buttons will change "a lot".

Besides dispatching "button presses" to the appropriate components,
there's one major responsibilty the controller has (not covered explicitly
in the overview pseudocode): managing the selection of components. Actually
it does sort of fit in to the framework laid down by the pseudocode.

(This feels like a responsibility that should be abstracted out into a
different controller that is somehow injected; BUT this also feels like it
may be early abstraction.)


Objectives in practice

To the end of decomposing this for testing, receiving a keypress results
in a response but does NOT itself change the state of the controller OR
components... (EDIT: say something about accept the response)
