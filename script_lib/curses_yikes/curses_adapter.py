"""
(about four days into this project it occured to us that maybe it's possibly
more than just a tiny windowing toolkit for curses (maybe we would want to
use it in a tiny REPL that doesn't need ncurses, maybe we could use it as
an "interface description language" to generate interfaces in arbitrary
other modalities..) so we thought it would be prudent to keep *all*
interactions with curses proper in its own abstraction layer. As it works out
this is also all the stuff that doesn't get covered ðŸ™ƒ)
