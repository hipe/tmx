    """traverse every line of input, effecting state changes.

      - implement the parsing grammar through a state machine whose
        transitions correspond to changes in indent from one line to
        another (with special handling for blank lines). (below we'll
        say "indentation deltas" to mean changes in indentation from
        one line to another (including the "no change" change))

      - the transitions in the state machine will effect "actions"
        (code) that probaly places each input line somewhere into a
        stack which will somehow end up as the output tree.

      - the responsibility here is simply to traverse every line of
        input straightforwardly, comparing each current line to each
        previous line, effecting the appropriate transition at each
        hop (again, recognizing blank lines as special).

      - detail: let a "hop" be the transition from one line to another.
        any sequence of N lines has N-1 hops. hops are what effect state
        machine transitions, and transitions are how actions are
        effected, and actions are where our result structure is built.

        we want the first line of input to trigger the same indentation-
        delta-based mechanics as the rest of the parsing, but note there
        is no hop onto the first line because there is no pre-existing
        line to compare it to. so imagine this:

        imagine an "imaginary line before the first line" that:
          - is not a blank line
          - has no indent

        modeling such an imaginary line has these advantages:

          - we get to have One Loop to rule them all, that handles
            the first line indifferently from other lines.

          - there are certain special assertions that we want to make of the
            first line of input: that it is not a blank line, that it is not
            indented. we can effect these assertions "for free" through our
            state machine by virtue of not modeling those transitions we
            disallow. but in order to employ the state machine for this
            purpose, we have to see the first line of input in terms of an
            indentation delta just as we do the other lines.

          - as it works out, we also want to make these same assertions
            for every first line of a top-level section, not just the
            first line of input. we will re-use this this "imaginary
            line" for this purpose #here2.
