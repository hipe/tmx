# the skylab "callback" sidesystem

## objective & scope

the skylab "callback" ([ca]) sidesystem evolved to become the home of
the most essential & commonly used facilities in the skylab libraries.
the fact that it is called "callback" is now largely historical - we are
looking for a better name for it.

examples of these most essential services are:

  • our autoloading system

  • event-related facilities
