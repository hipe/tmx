• blocks - each block represents a run of one or more adjacent
lines from the input. (lines are virtual - internally we only
store indexes.) lines are never broken by matches:

rather, each block is partioned such that it is either a run
of one or more lines that do not overlap with any matches -OR-
a run of one or more lines each of which overlaps with matches.

a match can span multiple lines -AND- a line can
overlap with (or contain fully) multiple matches;
so the block with matches will be busy.

but note that blocks without matches are forever unaffected by
substitions (provided that you don't memoize line numbers).

• the document only has a handle on its (any) first block. each
block is then doubly-linked to its any previous and any next
block, allowing the document to traverse itself in this manner.

the above facilitates this: each next block is constructed
lazily, so only as many blocks are built as is required by
the operation.

• match controllers - each block that has match controllers
exposes access to those controllers. each match controller has a
handle on its custodian block. through this each match controller
can (indirectly) reach any previous or next match controller, or
any above/below lines.
