"""this is HIGHLY experimental and GUARANTEEED to change ARCHITECTURALLY..

the primary objective is to rid ourselves of a deep coupling (dependence)
on flask. (it's useful for what it is but we'd be shooting ourselves in
the foot to build the assumption of flask deep into our stack.)

as such, this is a thin abstraction layer that gets "injected" with an
expression-agent-like thing that is basically just a wrapper around flask
stuff, but done so in a way that this file can be pointed at a different
web server library with little-to-no change.

a charitable reading would be to see this as something like a pillar of an
MVC, but that's overly charitable. this is more like a flask app without
using it by name.
