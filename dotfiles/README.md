- This file would normally be in a dedicated "dotfiles/doc"
  directory, but we are holding off on making such an anemic
  directory for now


# Objective, Scope & Features

Keep dotfiles in version control.

Features:
  - For most dotfiles, installer simply makes symlinks to files versioned here
  - Minimal templating


# Wishlist/Issues

  - Templating is a hack (but we want to keep it simple)


# Notes

Files that were described by (Stack Exchange #71253)[1] but don't get called
on our machine:

  - .zprofile
  - .zlogin
  - .zlogout
