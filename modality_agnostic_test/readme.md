At #history-B.3 we buried a bunch of stuff about the previous taxonomy
of this package vis-a-vis the taxonomy of the test files. At this historypoint
we flattened the structure of the test files and now there is almost nothign
to explain.



## test case numbering allocation table:

  - 0001-3333  test support
  - 3334-9999  the rest



## (document-meta)

  - #history-B.3
  - #born.
