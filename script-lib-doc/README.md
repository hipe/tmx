# script lib doc

## objective & scope

a nexus for all things CLI DRY'ed from scripts. the development rubric is
that we let this library evolve practically and iteratively; not as much by
design.



### our :[#608.6] "holy 6" internal API for CLI components

(At #history-A.3 we sunsetted the description of this API. At #history-A.2
we sunsetted the use of the API itself. At #history-A.1 we sunsetted [#608.5]
the related API that preceded this one.)



## <a name="node-table"></a>the node table

(this is a [\[#002\]] node table.)
(our range is 601-699)
