# Objective & Scope:

The goal is a frontend toolkit for drawing nodes (squares (tiles)) and
links between them, sort of in the spirit of the UI for [cables.gl][cab].



# Development notes:

  - `yarn run prepublish`

For the complete scattered notes leading up to this, see notecard
"TJ2" and "TK2" lol.
