## objective & scope

(ideas that belong to the distant future if anywhere at all..)

EDIT: do we really want these in here? i think the idea was to avoid chaotic
overflow of small things in the main node collection; but it seems like they
might grow stale here. could they each just have an entry in sibing README.md
to _this_ file, where each such node has its own sub-node identifier and a
special, shared tag?




## the node table

(this table follows the format provisioned by [\[#002\]] using the node table.)

|Id                         | Main Tag | Content
