## About this directory

- In effect, this is a fixture directory
- It's placed here for now to be next to the other directory like it
- It's structured differently: there's no `content/` directory, and
  the config file (normally sibling to the `content/` directory) is instead
  sibling to the `pages/` directory. We structure it this way because we
  can: the paths to the config file and to the `pages/` directory are passed
  in separately and explicitly as ARGV arguments/options to pelican
