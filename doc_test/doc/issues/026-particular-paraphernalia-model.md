# a particular paraphernalia model

## synopsis

this is all experimental. give consideration to the extent to which
particular expression is achieved simply by making a "particular"
counterpart class with *the same name* as the "common" paraphernalia
class. originally we had intended that we would us different names
so that the particular paraphernalia would use the appropriate
jargon/terms-of-art for the particular test suite solution
item, but that would require a custom "choices" class that maps names..




## spec-ish

it is up to the particular common paraphernalia (got that?) to decide ..

one day it would be nice to give "vertical reflection" so that the
common paraphernalia asks the particular paraphernalia what is its
expression shape (string, line, or lines) and then report that as *its*
expression shape..
