# a list of lists of the sidesystems.
#
#   • the two lists constitute broadly the app-likes and list-likes
#     variously BUT:
#
#   • lop off a trailing contiguous segment of the longer list and put it
#     somewhere in the shorter list until the time lengths are the
#     closest they can be. (currently: [te] and [ta])
#
#   • in app-likes the "hotter" are towards the front (so fail fast)
#
#   • the lib-like list has three sections:
#     "hot", "chokey (alphab.)", and "the rest (alphab.)"
