[#156]       codepoints tagged with this tag exhibit this pattern:

             besides just memoing what the particular value was we also memo
             that this method called at all. this allows us to differentiate
             between it having been set explicitly to false-ish vs. it having
             not been set at all.

             (the same could be achieved thru `instance_variable_defined?`,
             but such a way introduces more risk for hard-to-trace failure
             though typos. alternately we could have two variables
             instead of one, but it deemed too noisy.)

             setting it to false-ish says explicitly "i don't want an X".
             when it is not set at all, the receiver can detect this
             case lazily and effect whatever it deems as default at
             whatever future point.

[#003]       spawned off of [#023], if you have a lower-level object
             (a "performer") that needs to read more than one or two
             parameters from the higher-level object (the "client"),
             this hack can save lines of code while sacrificing
             idiomacy ("clarity") - make a plain old dup of the
             higher-level object, and send `extend` to that dup with a
             module (the would-be perfomer class). now use the dup
             as you would any ordinary performer.

             this couples the performer entirely to that subset of those
             ivars in the client (in both constituency and name) so
             always keep such a hack in the same file, and use it only
             for small performers.
