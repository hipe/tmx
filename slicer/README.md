# the skylab "slicer" utility

## objective & scope

this project started out as a stub placemarker for a vaporware. that
dream still exists but we won't describe it just yet.

this has also become a place of refuge for concerns relating to the
skylab/tmx ecosystem as a whole: things like creating dependency graphs
of the whole system, etc.
