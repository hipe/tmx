# the skylab "slicer" utility

## objective & scope

this project started out as a stub placemarker for a vaporware. that
dream still exists but we won't describe it just yet.

January 2022:

- `filter-repo` > `filter-branch` (but we didn't use either)
- We used [this stackoverflow article][so1]
- See also [#153] a bash script example (but we didn't use this technique)
- See [#TMX002]  (INSTALLATION) (if you're looking for that)

this has also become a place of refuge for concerns relating to the
skylab/tmx ecosystem as a whole: things like creating dependency graphs
of the whole system, etc.
