# numberspace schema

there's about 9 items in [#408] and we want to occupy the first
1/3 of numberspace for this first pass, so:

    tmx/test_support/bin/tmx-test-support-subdivide 0:333:9

which gives us:

  - 018.5 base class for format adapter itself
  - 055.5 in memory real object stream
  - 092.5 synchronizer for list of names
  - 129.5 item level synch
  - 166.5
  - 203.5
  - 240.5
  - 277.5
  - 314.5
