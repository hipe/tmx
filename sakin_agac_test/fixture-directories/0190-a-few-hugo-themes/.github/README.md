# hi.

this file is here only so there is something in the containing directory.

the containing directory, in turn, is here only to be like the real one..

yes, at writing, the containing directory (called (yuck) ".github") is used:
the asset script is written to ignore this directory (which is present when
we run the asset script in production).
