## the numbering scheme

of the test folders siblng to this file that have numbers (all should have
numbers) the numbers are intended to express a [#010.6] regression-friendly
order. they are inspired by a numbering scheme that is something like this:

  - 100: private models
  - 200: public models
  - 300: private magnetics
  - 400: public magnetics
  - 500: public API endpoints (or similiar)
  - (600-999: modality integrations)

while the particular numbers used may vary; please recognize and
promulgate the spirit of [#010.6] regression-friendliness.
