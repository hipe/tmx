"""The Minimal FSA Library :[#505]

- Nowadays we do a simpler way
- Mostly just keep track of what state you are in (as a name string) and
  assert that you can change into whatever other state name you set
- Compare the more complicated [#504], which adds structural representation
  of transitions and maybe actions
- Define your "formal" FSA with a dictionary whose string keys are the state
  names and whose values are tuples of strings, each string representing a
  state that can be transitioned to from that state. ("FFSA")
- The above's forward references will be asserted at definition time
- An *actual* FSA (just "FSA") is effectively just a FSA plus a string
  to keep track of which state it's in, and "locking":
- Derived from practice, you can "lock" temporarily the FSA using a string
  name. This allows you to lock out state changes while you do a particular
  operation, without neededing to add a node to the formal state (and two
  trasitions) just to achieve the locking effect
- Along the same lines as above, we allow you to enter into "failure lock"
  which locks out any further changes permanantly
- Attempts to move to an unreachable state or to change state when locked
  all give natural-souding and helpful error messages
- No support for UI integration (e.g., listeners) yet: all failures are
  currently raised as exceptions which are not yet part of the public API
- No coverage yet. early-abstracted from one client
