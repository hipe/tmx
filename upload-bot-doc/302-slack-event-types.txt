# this file is meant to serve as an auxiliary reference (augmenting the
# existing (ample) slack documentation documenting the slack app API)
# to the slack event types.
#
#   - it is *not* authoritative. it is guaranteed current only at writing.
#   - it is semi-machine generated. (copy-paste of web page, formatted)
#   - the only value it adds is the categories, which are in a certain order
#   - it is ordered big-to-little, with more static/general stuff at top, etc
#   - it is desigend to be machine-readable (fixed width yikes)
#   - ..so that hypothetically we could keep it current semi-automatedly
