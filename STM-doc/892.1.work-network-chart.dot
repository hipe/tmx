digraph g {
label="fix 892.1) Flutter toy app work network chart (sketch)"

/*
Note: at writing, this graph exists "in parallel" as a hand-written
table in our notebook, roughly following a PERT-chart structure.

(We switched from analog to digital for this one part of it because we
did not want to attempt this visualization by hand!)

The node identifiers are allocated "by hand" pseudo-randomly. As such, the
identifiers (and especially their relative "size") are meaningless. (We *did*
step over some allocations that could be confusing, like "QA" and "UX".)

The order of the nodes in this file corresponds to the order we wrote
the nodes in our notebook, which was from the bottom of the page upwards
in the order in which we thought of them.
