# Introducing "Skill Tree Maker"

This is a toy app whose purpose is to learn development with Flutter.

See "app flow" documentation for a journal of how we set up
our Flutter development environment.



# Development Notes (scope)

The main objective of this project (a toy app) is to figure out what our
own process is for other, non-toy apps.

We'll write things we do here for this project as a "scratch space".
As the thing feels like it's part of our process, we'll move the content
into "app flow".



# Development Notes

## Reminder of how to run the app

```bash
$ cd STM ; flutter run -d linux
```

## We are following this codelab

We are following [this codelab][cl1].



## beginnings: .. the beginnings.

Googled "flutter what to commit" got [dart what not to commit][g01].
Using that as a basis for our one-off script committed in this same
commit as this writing.
