## guidelines vaguely or wholly related to version control

  - please make sure you don't leave trailing whitespace on
    to the lines of any files unless you mean to.

  - when renaming files (i.e moving them), please commit the move(s) in a
    dedicated commit separate from commiting any edits to those files that
    moved. (reading edits to files in a diff can be ugly when it is paired
    with a move of the file, depending..)




## document-meta
