# down town fun readme

## objective & scope

for now, this can be any and everything we would like to version
for DTF: software, data, visualizations, whatever.

so at current, the scope is unbounded. but see the next section.




## development

for now, this project may host several disparate sub-projects.

as necessary, the sub-project (in the eyes of version control) may fork
into its own versioned project, after the fact. this is just to say: not
every project needs to start out with its own versioned repository. work
on it may start within this project at first.




## contents of this project:

  - "TODO.stack"
    - one line per item
    - see "doc/004-using-the-TODO-stack.md"

  - "doc/"
    - about this directory:
      - typically this is for *static*, semi-human readable documents
        (like markdown, graph-viz)

    - contents:

      - "003-which-channel-flowchart.dot"
        - you will need graph viz to see it

      - [other numbered markdown documents not listed here]


  - "static-html/"
    - about this directory:
      - these should be for *static* html and similar




## guidelines vaguely or wholly related to version control

  - please make sure you don't leave trailing whitespace on
    to the lines of any files unless you mean to.

  - when renaming files (i.e moving them), please commit the move(s) in a
    dedicated commit separate from commiting any edits to those files that
    moved. (reading edits to files in a diff can be ugly when it is paired
    with a move of the file, depending..)




## document-meta

  - #born.
