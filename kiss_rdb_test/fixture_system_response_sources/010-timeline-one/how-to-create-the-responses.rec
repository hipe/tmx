# This file is read by `modality_agnostic.fixture_system_responses`
#
# - This file is in a specialization of the "recfile" format: this file should
#   parse with the GNU `recsel` utility (or friends) (for example); however
#   our specialization of the format has its own spin on things:
#
# - One or more blank lines in a recfile designate a boundary between
#   records (when they are between field lines); but here there are no
#   "records" or "fields", only "directives"; and blanks lines are only
#   cosmetic, to group related directives together visually
#
# - Here you either can or can't have multiple directives of the same name
#   based on the directive name. Our parser will explain such failures
#
# - Order matters except where it doesn't. The parser will explain the
#   failures. (Behind the scenes there's an FSA; so in effect there's an
#   unpublished grammar.)
#
# This information (above) should be in documentation somewhere, but as long
# as this is the only such file, here is where the documentation lives too
