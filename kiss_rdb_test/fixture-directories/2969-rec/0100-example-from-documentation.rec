# The lines of this comment-block-run, the two blank lines following it, and
# our annotation line(s) near the end (e.g #birth and #history annotations)
# have been inserted into the received content; which otherwise appears
# exactly as-received.
#
# The #birth purpose of this file was merely for (Case3425DP) to produce *any*
# collection implementation that doesn't have the requisite (or any)
# .[#873.L] "capability functions", so that the story fails as expected.
# We will perhaps write the case only with stub classes, so that it doesn't
# not actually parse any of this content (a thing we shouldn't be doing
# anyway, but we do do for code that serves (Case1403)).
#
# At #history-B.1 (2 1/2 years later) we started using this in other tests.
