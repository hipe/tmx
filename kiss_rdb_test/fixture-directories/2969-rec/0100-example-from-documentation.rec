# The #birth purpose of this file was merely for (Case3425DP) to produce *any*
# collection implementation that doesn't have the requisite (or any)
# .[#873.L] "capability functions", so that the story fails as expected.
# We will perhaps write the case only with stub classes, so that it doesn't
# not actually parse any of this content (a thing we shouldn't be doing
# anyway, but we do do for code that serves (Case1403)).
