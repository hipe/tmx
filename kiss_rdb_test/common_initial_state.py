"""
Why and How

In production our line-based collection faÃ§ades are built from either
pathnames or already-open file resources (e.g STDIN, STDOUT, an open file)

In tests we represent files in a number of other ways: big strings, tuples
of lines, generators of lines. (See more at md RDCU test file tagged [#507.11])

It's tempting to bend our [#857.D] flowchart to accomodate all these other
shapes but it's a smell to write production code (logic not structure)
to accomodate only test scenarios

In the very old days we had the concept of a "mock filesystem" we would
inject. Then this got simplified to be an overidden `open` function that
got injected (always called `opn`)

But: EXPERIMENTALLY new in the coming edition, when the faÃ§ade builder is
passed what looks like an open filehandle, it's passed thru in a null
context manager and it's expected to read from it and (MAYBE) write to
it as appropriate without closing it

This newly supported argument type provides an easier, clearer way of
getting our fixture data in to the SUT. (We don't have to mock the "whole
filesystem" by implementing an `opn` function, we just pass in the mock
filehandle. (Still we use `opn` when we are testing with pathnames for
whatever reason.)

So, all this code-mess here is a mediation between all the different
ways we represent files in tests and the two ways we represent them in
production. (#[#873.26] whether and how we seek(0))


About the names

We use the word "pretend" to avoid the more stringent meanings associated
with "mock", "fake", "stub" (and "dummy"?), because this test double might
match those definitions to greater or lesser degrees based on what the
arguments are and how it's used. (We avoid the term "double" because we
find "pretend" to be more transparent and less ambiguous.)


Development & Future

There is ongoing tension between how much of this to abstract upwards.
We move new argument-handling routes up to the library package only as we
want them in other packages (at writing [dp])


A Small Note About Parameter Order

It may pain you that the agument order here is sometimes reverse what it is in
the library function (when it's (path, lines) here and there it's (lines, path)
but this inconsistency is by hard-fought design: in our test files it reads
better to have the pathname on top, before the lines, also when passing in
`opn` the lines argument becomes optional. However in the library file it is
the lines argument that's required and the pathname that is optional (e.g
when mocking STDIN).)
