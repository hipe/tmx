Right now this is just holding notes for the top secret project "anim".


# (Just as a record, how we started the notecard collection:)

## Create the collection:

```bash
kss create-collection eno anim-doc/notecards
```

(The above has a cosmetic error #open [#877.6].)


## Create the first notecard:
```bash
pho/backend.py create_notecard anim-doc/notecards heading wahoo
```

(Then we changed the identifer (location and name of the file) to
be something mnemonic.)
