             :[#here.2]: tracks the phenomenon of creating a "stub file"
             with no real content that is never loaded. a prerequisite for
             doing this is that the node's content is "anemic"; i.e., it is
             not enough code to justify loading its own dedicated file, and
             so the content itself of the node is somewhere else (usually
             in the parent node).

             but we might maintain an empty "stub" file nonetheless for any
             combination of the following reasons:

             keeping the file in a directory advertises the presence of
             the node more "loudly". if it's a magnetic, we may want to
             emphasize how it fits in with other magnetics; a practice that
             is facilitied by having a real file on the filesystem.

             similarly, we may want to advertise "loudly" the presence of
             the magnetic so that it is not overlooked during future work,
             when we are surveying what magnetics are availale when
             considering how to pathfind a problem.

             finally, in the cases where there is interesting history in
             a file that *becomes* "anemic", it may be that we don't want to
             bother ever loading the file but we want to keep it around
             for "continuity with the past and future"; i.e so that the
             node is not divoreced completely from its past.
