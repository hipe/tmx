[#012]       unified langauge for magnetics implementation

[#011]       magnetics item syntax..

             (why are we getting that empty node and label)

[#009]       this needs comparative analysis (has subscribers)

[#008]       synthesis dependencies..

[#007]       for tracking - we have a circular dependency expression
             logic, so do areas marked with this tag.

[#006]       where's that one thing (in situ)

             "the dream of magnetics" is pathfinding in directed graph
             A) we've done it somewhere in the universe before
             [magnetics viz]  (in branch at writing) (has subscribers)
