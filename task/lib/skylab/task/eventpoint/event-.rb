    # #todo - de-orphanize this file

    # :NOTE: the original main content of this file was an ANCIENT
    # alphabetical list of what we now call "expressive micro-agents".
    # "structured expressive agents" (pushed up to [#co-003.1]) are
    # generally the idea that you can have an object that is struct-like
    # but also knows how to express itself into a string under a general
    # modality-specific expression agent.
    #
    # we took this idea to an extreme here combined with another idea that
    # *all* EN for the library should be in this one file, ostensibly to
    # ease some future imagined pain of internationalization. some of our
    # "micro-agents" only existed to express one word! you still see traces
    # of that now.
    #
    # nowadays we find it impractical to hold ourself to this constraint,
    # but as for the expressive micro-agents that remain,
    # they aren't getting a deeper refactor because emissions are an
    # auxiliary side to our central function

    # during the modernification, we became less concerned with keeping all
    # EN in one file so the responsibility of this file shrank. now it's
    # meant to be only expression support and *reusable* expression micro-
    # agents. those m.a's that were only used for one kind of event have
    # been pushed out to where they are used.
