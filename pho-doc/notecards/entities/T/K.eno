## npm vs yarn

We liked the idea of using yarn over npm because of our sort of "shiny thing"
impulse of wanting to be on the vanguard (remmmber when we got bit by
using `poetry` instead of `pip`)?

But this [blog article][nvy] makes it sound like the hop between yarn 1 and
yarn 2 had negative side-effects that didn't jive with parts of the node
ecosystem (including React Native, which we might use), and in the mean time
npm tried to address some of the shortcomings that lead to yarn in the first
place.

[Here] shows (something)

Notwithstanding, we apprecaite the architectural ideas of yarn 2, and have
nothing to lose by trying it on this greenfield environment.


## setting up environment

[Here][env] was the simple way to download the zip file and copy the big
(2K SLOC) file over and import it into your web page.

But (a decision we'll probably change later) We'll start with [yarn][yar]


```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

(and upgraded npm with `npm install -g npm` to get: `6.14.9 â†’ 7.5.2`)

Then:

```bash
yarn set version berry
```

We followed [which yarn files should be ignored][yig] (the "Zero-installs"
one.)
