# sakin agac

(bastardized for the nonsensical turkish "calm tree")




## objective & scope

our current [broad objectives][\[#403\]] are discussed in their own document.

these were the original stated objectives, here (in part) for posterity:
  - learn react.
  - experiment with unobtrusive static pages
  - do that one static thing with tables
  - do that one static pipeline with webpack




## sub-node table (experiment)
