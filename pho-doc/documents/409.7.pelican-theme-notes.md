# How we adapted the sphinx Alabaster theme to pelican

The [Alabaster][1] theme is distributed as a python pip package, but it is
of little use to us unless it's run through the sphinx ecosystem.



## 1. Install sphinx and build a dummy project

Following the [sphinx docs][2], install sphinx as a pip package, then
quickstart. (You don't have to do this any more; this is just here for
posterity. We turned the relevant parts into [#410.Y] a task.):

```bash
pip install -U sphinx
mkdir foo-foo ; cd foo-foo
sphinx-quickstart
```

Accept defaults and enter some dummy names for author and project.


We don't need these directories:

```bash
rmdir _build _templates
```

(We then turn what was left of this into a unified diff patchfile,
which we use in the aforementioned task.)
