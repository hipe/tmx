## How We Installed Pelican

According to [the pelican documentation][url1]:

```bash
pip install "pelican[markdown]"
mkdir pho-doc/pelican-experiment
cd !$<tab>
pelican-quickstart
```

Then we answered a bunch of questions.

Then we wrote the example page.

Then to generate content:

```bash
pelican content
```

Then to start the local pelican webserver:

```bash
pelican --listen
```

More better:
```bash
pelican --listen --autoreload
```

(Note that pelican didn't get added to our requirements.txt until more
than a a month later, at #history-B.4. Also at the same history point there
is now an invoke task for patching pelican. But this is liable to change
soon.)

Single page (specify path to output file):
```bash
pelican --write-selected output/posts/my-post-title.html
```



# Quick notes on themes

bootstrap
cebong (newsprint looking)
dev-random2 (kind of funny)
flex (adaptive)
foundation-default-colors (hm)
frantic (lol)
jesuislibre (lol)
mg (adaptive)
mnmlist
pelican-blue (adaptive)
twenty-html5up (fancy design)
voce (design, adaptive)




## Imagine patching pelican

- pelukan/settings.py:592: lists parameters not in ":25"
- similar to above: not in same but used: 'AUTHOR', 'TIMEZONE'
- pelukan/utils.py:854: not `f.endswith`, use splitext.
  Take whatever other work out of the loop
- pelukan/contents.py:78 "XXX Split all the [..] there is too much here."
