# the dim-sum table of file-monitoring tools


Here is how we populated the table:

```bash
curl https://anarc.at/blog/2019-11-20-file-monitoring-tools/ > x.html
dp scrape x.html div.toc 'ol:nth-of-type(1)>li:nth-of-type(1)>ol:nth-of-type(1)>li' 'a:nth-of-type(1)'
```
We did the rest "by hand". Syncing would be nice, but that is out of scope
for now. but #open [#437].

# this worked:

```bash
watchexec --verbose --no-shell --postpone  -w emn-my-working-directory --filter '*/some-dir/file-1.txt' --debounce 15 emn/some-file.py foo bar baz
```

We installed watchexce on OS X with:

```bash
brew install watchexec
```

as described in [its documentation][1].
