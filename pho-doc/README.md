## introduction, objective & scope

(EDIT get description from groupchat from around the time of #birth lol.)


## quick sketch

when we say WASD we mean:

    PREV                     NEXT
    +---------------------------+
    |          (BODY)           |
    +---------------------------+
                          ðŸ”’ edit


when edit is unlocked:

    PREV       CREATE        NEXT
    +---------------------------+
    |        (TEXTAREA)         |
    +---------------------------+
                   cancel ðŸ”“ save


when you click create

    NEW PREV              NEW NEXT
    +---------------------------+
    |        (TEXTAREA)         |
    +---------------------------+
                   cancel ðŸ”“ save
