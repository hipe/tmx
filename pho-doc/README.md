## introduction, objective & scope

The main intended purpose for this project (currently codenamed "pho" and
(interchangeablely but somewhat more formally) "TMX notebook") is for taking
reading notes, somewhat like the popular Apple application "Evernote".

(#edit [#880.B] get description from groupchat from around the time of #birth lol.)



## About the names & origin

In antiquity (late 2000's) we wanted to use a wiki to keep our own reading
note for learning Ruby on Rails, because back then there was no central home
for authoritative, complete documentation & tutorials for RoR; it was a
scattered diaspopra of dozens of blogs, many of which were in various states
of out-of-date or accurate or best-practice-y.

The idea was that we make a Mediawiki-like graph of documents that relate to
each other (today we might consider asciidoc), that would not only aid in our
own learning, but it could be hosted on a github-like and distributed and
modified by the opensource community. We considered disqus-like comments. We
imagined that with vigilant enough curation and editors, it could become a
de-facto central source of documentation for the whole thing.

We got as far as starting a few files, then we had a hardware accident and
got waylaid.

The idea fell to the backburner as real life advanced for about 10 years, but
then in 2018 we revisted the desire to be able to take notes and publish them.
The awkardly named "sakin-agac" was born. (Its first documented mention may
be in what is now [#401] the SSG dim-sum.)

Then in late 2019 and into 2020 (initially not realizing this is what we were
doing) we came in with a ground-up rewrite (with one major new architectural
idea) codenamed "pho".



## quick sketch

when we say WASD we mean:

    PREV                     NEXT
    +---------------------------+
    |          (BODY)           |
    +---------------------------+
                          ðŸ”’ edit


when edit is unlocked:

    PREV       CREATE        NEXT
    +---------------------------+
    |        (TEXTAREA)         |
    +---------------------------+
                   cancel ðŸ”“ save


when you click create

    NEW PREV              NEW NEXT
    +---------------------------+
    |        (TEXTAREA)         |
    +---------------------------+
                   cancel ðŸ”“ save
