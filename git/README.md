# the skylab "git" sidesystem

## objective & scope

this is an umbrella sidesystem for all major (and some minor)
undertakings having to do with the `git` SCM. it's largely a
"bone yard" for one particular large-ish utilities that once held some
novelty for us but is now useless. we still like "tmx-gix-unrename".
