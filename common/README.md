# the skylab "common" sidesystem

## objective & scope

the skylab "common" ([co]) sidesystem evolved to become the home of
the most essential & commonly used facilities in the skylab libraries.

(it used to be called "callback", and at writing traces of this name
may remain in some places, namely the `[ca]` medallion..)

examples of these most essential services are:

  • our autoloading system

  • event-related facilities
