# the simple stream manifesto :[#016.1]

## introduction

a "minimal stream" is and always will be an object that
responds to `gets` and results in a true-ish object if the stream has
any more items to give, or false-ish if it is all out of items.

a minimal stream is intentionally minimal: formally it is and always will
be defined by this one method only. [#016.2] the stream manifest develops
the idea further.

this particular implementation of minimal stream simply aliases the `call`
method of the Proc class to `gets` (but that is an implementation detail
that is done purely out of covenience).




## (random history)

(point of history: this document was formerly [#ba-022] but we
gravitated the nexus of streams up to this library because of its
growing universality.)




## overview of background & justification :[#here.3]

the stream idiom has become the favorite way to implement "producers" (or
even just to represent lists abstractly) in a general way. more generally
it is a "lingua franca" as perhaps the simplest (and least featureful)
way to represent a "collection" of items (for example, as a means of one
client representing a collection of items as an argument to another client
(often a "performer")).

we like the stream idiom because it lets us distill a huge swath of
data-structures and iteration operations down to one RISC-like minimal
standard on top of which we build back up our tools, making an even huger
variety of permuations of these operations both possible and easy.

below we will compare the properties of our streams to (variously) arrays
and enumerators, after introducing streams a bit more formally.




## defined

our formal definition for "stream" is intentionally spare, and takes its
"look and feel" from how we may get each line from an open filehandle:

  - a stream is stateful object that produces each next element with a
    call to `gets`. (unlike the `Kernel` method of the same name; this
    method must be public.)

  - a stream indicates that it has no more objects left to produce by
    resulting in a false-ish from a call to `gets`.

  - a corollary of the above is that a stream cannot be used to produce
    any item that could ever validly assume a falseish value (i.e `nil`
    or `false`).

really, that's it.

the fact that we use `gets` and not some other name is of course arbitrary.
(`call` and `next` were considered.) we borrow the name from ::IO because the
metaphor is such a precise fit, but bear in mind our streams are certainly
not limited to produing strings (the 's' in "gets"). however:

(as mentioned above,)
a corollary of the second point above forms one of the streams's most
defining limitations: a stream cannot be used to produce elements whose
valid state may include `nil` or `false`. (if you need to handle the
possibility of these values as being meaningful, consider [#069] scanner).




## streams vs. arrays :[#here.5]

axiomatically we will offer that any array whose every zero or more items
is true-ish can be represented losslessly as a stream. it is also true
that every stream can be "flattened" to an array (also losslessly).

we can then go so far as to say that this one category of arrays (on the
one hand) and all streams (on the other hand) are "isomorphic"; that is,
that they are two different ways of representing the same thing.

if this is the case, then it's worth asking: why bother using streams at
all if we can always substitute the more familiar array as a substrate
for holding our collection?

one reason (certainly not the only one) is performance. whereas as array
requires as much memory as the sum of the memory required to represent
each item (or whatever), a stream only needs to produce one item at once.

if (hypothetically) we were to make a long-running process that needed
to (er) process many millions of items, it would not scale if we needed
to hold all these items an array at once. even needing to map say 50 or
10 of an item can be a noticeable "hit" if the construction of your item
costs significant resources (storage, processing or otherwise).

another related performance gain is that of concurrency. we can chain
producers to consumers (exactly like a UNIX pipeline) and the one can
start working on processing items before the other is done producing all
the items.




## then arrays vs. streams  :[#here.6]

then the flip side of this point is to ask why ever use arrays at all?
to any programmer with more than one day of experience, this question might
sound absurd because of how ubiquitous arrays are in programming generally.
but in fact it's an interesting point: how often do you use arrays to
leverage their random access (by offset) abilities vs. how often do you use
them simply as a convenient way to represent a collection, of which each
item you only need to iterate over once?

as it works out, in "our universe" a very common pattern is that we start
out (somehow) with a collection that is represented as an array (either
coming "in" from some "outside" source or as having started out as (for
example) a hard-coded list of symbols); and then with such an array we
wrap it in a stream so that the consumer of this collection sees it only
as a stream and not as an array. this allows us to leverage the convenience
of each (variously) without incuring the cost of both (again variously).




## streaming vs. enumerating

### streams are like enumerators made portable mid-iteration

in the last year or so the stream idiom has overtaken the comparable
Enumerator construct as the generally prefered "universal interface" for
production operations for a few reasons:

whereas the Enumerator's big value prop is that it is a list iteration made
portable, a stream is a list iteration made portable along with its
"scan state" (that is, whether it's an array you're consuming or an
open filehandle or some other kind of stream, the stream keeps track of
whatever current next token (line, item, etc) it is you will read.

so one part of your code can build the stream, another part of the
code can advance it to a certain state, and a third part of the code may
do something with the rest, and so on.

with an enumerator all of this is possible, but it is not the kind of
interaction the enumerator was made for: an enumerator is like a wind-up toy:
it likes to unwind all at once, it doesn't easily stop in the middle. in order
to get only one element at a time from an enuemrator you have to call `next`
while catching a ::StopIteration, which is a show-stopping level of ugliness.

a stream is more like a PEZÂ® dispenser: it was engineered to issue precisely
one element at a time on-demand, rather than spit them out all at once.
like a PEZ dispenser it can be passed to one "person", that person can keep
taking PEZ until she is satisfied (i.e she reaches the quanitity she was
looking for, she finds the particular one she was looking for, or all the
PEZ run out); and then she can pass the dispenser on to the next appropriate
person and so on.

(to stretch the metaphor even further, the person she decides to pass the
dispenser to may itself be determined by what particular PEZ were that the
dispenser dispensed! but that's crazy talk.)



### a stream may be more efficient

this is not the primary reason we use them when we do, but [#bm-011] streaming
is more efficient than enumeraing for some operations, operations that often
describe our use case.

this is probably just because of the way we typically use them: an iteration
over an enumerator is usually done with something like `each`, a method that
creates one call frame for each iteration. whereas iteration over a stream
is usally done with sommething like `while`, which does not create its own
call frame. (producing a new call frame takes more work for the platform
runtime (and perhaps all programming language runtimes/binary objects) to
do than just calculating that it needs to iterate over a loop one more time.)



### a stream is not a general replacement for an enumerator.

as sugested above, the set of all lists that a stream may represent is a
subset of the set of all lists that an enumerator may represent because of the
semantic overloading we apply to the result value of `gets` (namely, when it
is false-ish it is a control-flow boolean, when it is true-ish it is both a
control-flow boolean and a business value).

although the reverse is not necessarily true, any stream may be translated
to an enumerator regularly (simply: your body of the enumerator is a while
loop iterating over your stream, and pass each element to the yeilder).

enumerators are still good for all the things that they are good for, so
don't use a stream when an enumerator is a better fit. our point in this
article is just to say that the stream is a better choice for a universal
way to model iteration, for the kinds of iterating we generally do.
