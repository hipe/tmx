# event makers :[#005]

- :[#here.A] tracks the transplant from [hl]. legacy.
  "the magical, multipurpose Event base class and variants"
  was broken up into [#B], [#C] and [#D]. [#B] wins the history.


- :[#here.B] is a reference to [#ba-063], which makes [#here.C] and [#here.D].


- :[#here.C] is what used to be the "magical, multipurpose" event class.


- :[#here.4] is the "hooks" (remotely referenced by [ba] only, probably)


- :[#here.E] is the "data event" (transplated from some old app ([sg]?))
         which is sorta like half of [#here.C].


- :[#here.F] is the "message" event (also transplated from same) which
         is sorta lke the other half of [#here.C].
