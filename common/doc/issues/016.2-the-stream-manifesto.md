# the stream manifesto :[#016.2]


## baseless streams #open :[#here.3]

this is a quick sketch for an idea
see

  snag/lib/skylab/snag/cli/core.rb

we concat one stream by another stream, and then prepend a third stream on
to that. while this is certainly possible with our functional approach, it
doesn't scale well.

what would be better is to take the approach we have taken in "no deps" [ze]
with the scanner there, which is to have a bevy of methods in a methods
module and then a RISC-like common small interface.

if you were then a client of such a stream and you knew its underlying
implementation was that of a "concatted stream" (which by the way should
be a scanner), you could, say

    orig_stream  # you know this is a concatted stream

    _st = [ new_stream, * orig_stream.release_constituent_array ]

    new_stream = Stream.via_stream_array _st

this way, the concatted stream stays as flat as it was originally the whole
time (better scale), and you can use the familiar array idioms to map new
concatted streams rather than needed prepend, concat etc.




### but it gets nastier:

unify "simple stream" and "stream" in the following ways: RISC-like,
move all the methods defined in 'stream/core.rb' up to core common file
(or don't, it's ~500) lines), but in any case get the 'stream' node
defined in the toplevel core file (we use it all the time and as it
is it is two hops in the autoloader)..
merge the three nodes  'scn--' to under the "stream" node..











## quick historical preface on a name change.

what we used to call "scans" in this universe are in a much more popular
universe called "streams". more precisely, our "scans" sounded like they
resembled their "streams" closely enough that not to rename our node would
probably only cause confusion, both for visitors from that universe and
inhabitants of this one. so we renamed our "scan" to "stream".

(also, we concede that "stream" is a better name: "scan" invokes
something that can perhaps peek and perhaps jump ahead given some
pattern (like a string scanner); by design we don't provide any such
complexities out of the box.)

one day it will be very interesting to see all the ways that the outside
("more popular") form differs from ours; but for now we remain
blissfully ignorant.

also we think it's telling that this facility emerged to prominence both
in our ecosystem and theirs at around the same time; but "independently".
because of our isolation we know that there was no direct
"cross-contamination":

on our little island, we discovered a penchant for these structures because
years ago we liked the simplicity of scanning lines from a file and thought
it would be useful to apply this pattern more broadly to other interactive
modalities like it.

little did we know that "streamifying" everything would become an
obsession that would consume us, but that's perhaps more of a personal
problem.




### on building streams and the visibility of the node

it is called `[cb]::Stream` and not (e.g) `[cb]::Stream__` in part
because that is the naming guideline for all nodes at the topmost
level of a sidesystem [#citation-needed]: such nodes are solidly part
of the subsystem so the code reads (and executes) more directly when
using these, rather than "rounded" singleton methods [#citation-needed].

in practice we most frequently build streams either functionally
or with one of the convenience macros (singleton methods with names
like `build_a_stream_from_a_nonsparse_array` or
`build_a_stream_with_this_one_trueish_item_as_its_only_item (names are
made up but equivalent methods exist)).

(at the time of this writing occurrences of the former had a count
of 46 and the latter 91, for a ratio of about 1:2 hand-written
functions-to-macros.)

for the case where we are building your stream functionally (e.g
often with proc that calls another proc that changes during the
traversal of your stream), it is best to use the `[cb].stream` rounded
singleton method rather than accessing `Stream` directly, because we
would like some implementation hiding: the fact that we subclass
::Proc is "elegant" as an implementation but should not be assumed,
hence the below former is prefered to the below latter:

    my_stream = [cb].stream do
      # ..
    end

the above is better than the below:

    my_stream = [cb]::Stream.new do
      # ..
    end

the former is preferred because we don't want to publicize the fact
that we are subclassing Proc -- this implementation may change.




## introduction

a "stream" is a [#016.1] minimal stream with lots of methods added to it.
whereas a "minimal stream" is intentionally .. minimal (has only one
method), a
"stream" comes with a whole bunch of methods useful for mapping,
reducing, expanding, generating random access controllers, etc.

with a stream we can do interesting chaining:

    _st = my_stream.reduce_by do |x|
      :some_condition == x.some_value
    end.map_by do |x|
      Some_Other_Class.new x
    end

    FeatureBranch_via_Stream.define do |o|
      o.upstream = _st
      o.key_method_name = :some_method
    end

so we take a potentially large set of results, reduce it down to a
smaller set, build some wrapper objects around it, and put them into a
dictionary-like random accessor. note that all of the insides of the
above blocks are evaluated lazily - none of it is executed until it is
necessary to do so.




## random-access notes

(these notes are stowaways here, piggybacking-in from the "random
access" child node. they are not part of the stream narrative proper.)


### :#ra-105

the "value mapper" is an experimental hack that lets you map your items
thru and arbitrary proc before the result comes from `[]` and `fetch`.
it may be useful if you have a parse structure you are trying to make
act like a dictionary.

it is not for reduce operations. if you result in false-ish from your
mapper proc, behavior is undefined.

we must not store this result internally, because internally the topic
class may rely on the stored items responding to the key method, as
well..




### :#ra-180

we are being requested a key we haven't already seen when we haven't
yet seen all the keys. use the existing scanner we are wrapped around
*from the current position it is in*, keep grabbing items off of it until
either we find the item being sought or we run out of items, all the while
storing each item and its key.
