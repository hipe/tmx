# "arc" (the autonomous component system)

## brief introduction

"the ACS" is not so much a library in the traditional, object-oriented sense
but more a set of conventions you can opt-in to in a piecemeal way in
your classes; and a corresponding collection of library *functions*
(usually) that can do something interesting with participating objects.




## etymology

"arc" is the terminology used in graph theory to describe an association
between two nodes. this library's focus is largely about associations.
