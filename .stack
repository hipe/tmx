creative self actualization
maybe a CLI (explode me)
Cover DELETE that would leave entites file empty
cover yes schema file but no ent entites dir
a lot of the names in state machine module are still EXPERIMENTAL
"business schema" that has a primitive types section
base actions perhaps not needed for that one actions
codename WASD
learn enough SDK to make WASD
have full on eno
[#874.9] files marked as "LEGACY" should be seated or deleted
there are todo's
get those placeholder values out of there with default AUTHOR and TIMEZONE
[#882.D] marks old code that needs removal after re-arch
for each production "notecards" directory (there's 2), modernize to new way
  (exit criteria for above: whole site for collection looks good)
pho pelican adapter output "strict nav tree"-compatible "Chilren" frontmatter component
  (also it's gotta output articles not pages now, this will affect the service)
maybe alter pho so documents with children documents are allowed (or encouraged (or required))
  (alternately our branch nodes will have no content (yuck), or alternately..)
