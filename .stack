creative self actualization
maybe a CLI (explode me)
function for create (random allocation of new ID)
be able to map (index) ID's for a whole collection
integrate w/ lock & rewrite file
update attributes
create attributes (including into empty entity)
delete attributes
maybe a request structure (abstract gist from previous)
just for the model thing (true unit test)
the algorithm document for attribute CUD
