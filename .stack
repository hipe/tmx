creative self actualization
maybe a CLI (explode me)
Cover DELETE that would leave entites file empty
cover yes schema file but no ent entites dir
a lot of the names in state machine module are still EXPERIMENTAL
multiline strings
"business schema" that has a primitive types section
base actions perhaps not needed for that one actions
