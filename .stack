the big question - slicer (G)->(B)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff (C)
unify table under [ze] and then re-apply this to [tmx] counts (covered, add totals row and fix layout)
fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`, memoize vs lazy) (B)
try to simplify [ac]/[ze] procure bound call
[tm] change actors and sessions to magnetics
[tm] no more Selective_Builder_Receiver_Sender_Methods
use [sa] to convert etc to Stream_
-1 script to calculate costs [#tmx-011] then [#tmx-010]
-2 the cost-driven divvy algorithm [#tmx-012]
-3 unify other tmx node-centric services [#tmx-015]
[#tmx-018.3] primaries of the `select` operation should show up in the `test-all` screen
[#tmx-019] get fuzzy out of multimode scanner
(eventpoint event can go away to somewhere)
[ze] Expresser needs slight cleanup, should be simple model
(-4 cleanup the items between this one and -3)
-5 [br] is renovated when it is only datastore adapteres and the example app
-6 [cs] have fun figuring out what to do with isomorpic methods client
-7 also: decide if entity library is deprecated (#open [#fi-034.1])
-17 down to -7 (11 items): [ta],[gv],[cu],[cm],[gi],[f2],[bs],[tr],[sl],[st],[co]
-18.333 down to -18.001: [sg] all CLI down to finish
explain MTk and associate the explanation with its nodes
-18.666 down to -18.334: [sg] all API etc
-18.833: break out entity into its own library, flush incidentals
