the big question - slicer (G)->(B)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff (C)
unify table under [ze] and then re-apply this to [tmx] counts (covered, add totals row and fix layout)
fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`, memoize vs lazy) (B)
try to simplify [ac]/[ze] procure bound call
[tm] change actors and sessions to magnetics
[tm] no more Selective_Builder_Receiver_Sender_Methods
use [sa] to convert etc to Stream_
-1 script to calculate costs [#tmx-011] then [#tmx-010]
-2 the cost-driven divvy algorithm [#tmx-012]
-3 unify other tmx node-centric services [#tmx-015]
[#tmx-018.3] primaries of the `select` operation should show up in the `test-all` screen
[#tmx-019] get fuzzy out of multimode scanner
  (#open [#ts-030.C] quickie plugin arch needs re-arch - too confusing)
  (#open [#ts-032.A] the "counts report is not covered)
  (#open [#ts-032.B] verbose mode for counts is borked)
  (totally unrelated: relate [#ts-033] to some place in slowie)
  move to "microservice" or wontfix: #open [#ts-005] stylize
  (consider adding an explicit "traverse examples" state to eventpoint graph)
  (somewhere do default operation (run tests) - this will be harder - CLI only)
  (somewhere do default primary - so filename withouth -path - CLI only)
