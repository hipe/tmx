the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff
no more regret
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`)
look into better intergration of dev (click on stack frames)
recursive for CLI
eliminate old doctest manifest file b.c all is new
every old [dt] test that requires shared setup
every old [dt] test that is easy (use and modify CLI for this as needed)
map/reduce/expand every old doc-test manifest time into an item in THIS stack
re-classify and line-up the more difficult ones
./basic/lib/skylab/basic/proxy/inline.rb  "good first candidate for shared subject"
./brazen/lib/skylab/brazen/cli-support/option-parser/actors.rb  "simple as is but should be broken up"
./basic/lib/skylab/basic/hash/as-ordered.rb  "clunky for one test but hard to break up"
./human/lib/skylab/human/levenshtein.rb  "good first one"
./basic/lib/skylab/basic/list/core.rb  "good first one"
./common/lib/skylab/common/scn--/core.rb   "could stand to be broken up but meh"
./common/lib/skylab/common/scn--/peek--.rb  "even simpler first one"
