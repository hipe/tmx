the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff
no more regret
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`)
reverse synchronization (or postpone)
recursive for CLI
recursive for API
recursive magnetics (one-by-one)
unit of work stream
probably participating file stream
counterpart test index
counterpart directory
