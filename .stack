the big question - slicer (G)->(B)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff (C)
unify table under [ze] and then re-apply this to [tmx] counts (covered, add totals row and fix layout)
fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`, memoize vs lazy) (B)
try to simplify [ac]/[ze] procure bound call
[tm] change actors and sessions to magnetics
[tm] no more Selective_Builder_Receiver_Sender_Methods
use [sa] to convert etc to Stream_
