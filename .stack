the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's)
reverse synchronization (or postpone)
recursive for CLI
recursive for API
recursive magnetics
--
re-house "file coverage" in [ts] not [st]
freshen up [ts] CLI
restore file coverage CLI
CLI tests pass
CLI visual inspection works (use realistic use cases)
new backend with bugfix/new feature
universal small cleanup
