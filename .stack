the big question - slicer (G)->(B)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff (C)
unify table under [ze] and then re-apply this to [tmx] counts (covered, add totals row and fix layout)
fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`, memoize vs lazy) (B)
try to simplify [ac]/[ze] procure bound call
[tm] change actors and sessions to magnetics
[tm] no more Selective_Builder_Receiver_Sender_Methods
use [sa] to convert etc to Stream_
-1 script to calculate costs [#tmx-011] then [#tmx-010]
-2 the cost-driven divvy algorithm [#tmx-012]
-3 unify other tmx node-centric services [#tmx-015]
[#tmx-018.3] primaries of the `select` operation should show up in the `test-all` screen
[#tmx-019] get fuzzy out of multimode scanner
-3.103 help screen for quickie
-3.109 request parsing must reconcile the state machine (probably a new branch)
-3.114 plugins are somehow baseless and autonomous but also poka-yoke near DSL
-3.120 plugin discovery only happens if there's primaries to parse
-3.125 tree runner can be invoked by a CLI or API scanner
-3.132 tree runner is built with an argument scanner and a filesystem
-3.138 rename sessions-/execute to plugins/execute-tests
-3.143 rename front to tree runner
-3.149 restore [cs] in new way
-3.155 bring back each test but in new way
-3.161 begin to splice into it the same kind of event handler of tmx
-3.166 wip all of [cs] and tests for it
-3.172 re-seat isomorphic methods client as CLI microservice toolkit
