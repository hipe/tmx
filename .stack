the big question - slicer (G)->(B)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff (C)
unify table under [ze] and then re-apply this to [tmx] counts (covered, add totals row and fix layout)
fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`, memoize vs lazy) (B)
try to simplify [ac]/[ze] procure bound call
[tm] change actors and sessions to magnetics
[tm] no more Selective_Builder_Receiver_Sender_Methods
use [sa] to convert etc to Stream_
-1 script to calculate costs [#tmx-011] then [#tmx-010]
-2 the cost-driven divvy algorithm [#tmx-012]
-3 unify other tmx node-centric services [#tmx-015]
[#tmx-018.3] primaries of the `select` operation should show up in the `test-all` screen
[#tmx-019] get fuzzy out of multimode scanner
  (#open [#ts-030.C] quickie plugin arch needs re-arch - too confusing)
  (#open [#ts-032.A] the "counts report is not covered)
  (#open [#ts-032.B] verbose mode for counts is borked)
-3.090 #open [#ts-002] coverage in the recursive runner
  (the below is #open [#ts-030.B])
-3.103 help screen for quickie
-3.109 request parsing must reconcile the state machine (probably a new branch)
-3.125 tree runner can be invoked by a CLI or API scanner
-3.127 overhaul of pathfinding to use state machine and DRY that plugin guy
-3.132 testfile -1
-3.141 testfile -2
  .. "baseless" gonna go away too
-3.150 testfile -3
  .. "digraphic" is available to you
-3.159 testfile -4
  (totally unrelated: relate [#ts-033] to some place in slowie)
  wontfix or move to "microservice": #open [#ts-005] stylize
  open [#ts-036] indentation
-0.038 universal integration closes: [#ts-004] module names (and:)
-0.077 consider #wish [#ts-030.4] quickie onefile drops into recursive runner
-0.115 re-integrate with recursive runner - note no line ranges there, yes tags
