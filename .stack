the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff
no more regret
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`)
look into better intergration of dev (click on stack frames)
recursive for CLI
eliminate old doctest manifest file b.c all is new
every old [dt] test that requires shared setup
every old [dt] test that is easy (use and modify CLI for this as needed)
wippify the magic byte sequences themselves as a way to have a punchlist (maybe)
cross-reference the actual list of files with byte sequence with the punchlist:
   3) painstakingly line up the valid entries with the list
   2) make a category for dud matches and add a category value and put at the end
   1) a new punchlist with every line exactly one-to-one, note the line-numbers
