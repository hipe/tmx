the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx])
reverse synchronization (or postpone)
recursive for CLI
recursive for API
recursive magnetics
CLI integration for single
integration: solve a contrived problem with both
find a path: don't cycle, find shortest path, whine when not found
represent functions
represent manners and let them write an API onto your interface class
