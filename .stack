the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff
no more regret
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`)
look into better intergration of dev (click on stack frames)
recursive for CLI
eliminate old doctest manifest file b.c all is new
every old [dt] test that requires shared setup
every old [dt] test that is easy (use and modify CLI for this as needed)

after unification -

./test_support/lib/skylab/test_support/sandbox.rb  (1 setup, 1 test)  NO TEST - NO USAGE? ASSET ISLAND?

multiline shared subject -

./basic/lib/skylab/basic/method.rb  (constdef, assertion) (constdef, asst 2x, assertion 4x)

./parse/lib/skylab/parse/functions-/serial-optionals.rb (break this up, the last context)

./parse/lib/skylab/parse/functions-/alternation.rb ACCEPTANCE TEST CASE
