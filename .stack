the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff
no more regret
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`)
look into better intergration of dev (click on stack frames)
recursive for CLI
eliminate old doctest manifest file b.c all is new
every old [dt] test that requires shared setup
every old [dt] test that is easy (use and modify CLI for this as needed)
map/reduce/expand every old doc-test manifest time into an item in THIS stack
