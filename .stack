the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx])
reverse synchronization (or postpone)
recursive for CLI
recursive for API
recursive magnetics
CLI integration for single
-------
integration: solve a contrived problem with both (900-ish)
find a path: don't cycle, find shortest path, whine when not found (700-ish)
use proper pathfinding
maybe hinting away
simplify away the formal parameters - ..
maybe get @_collection out as an ivar (make it a method) (or not)
get rid of unused code at top of c15n (corefile) and review #todo's ↕
globally green ↕
"full" coverage (near ununsed code) ↕
make older tests like newer tests ↕
locally green ↕
