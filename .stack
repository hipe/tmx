maybe a CLI (explode me)
Cover DELETE that would leave entites file empty

"business schema" that has a primitive types section
base actions perhaps not needed for that one actions
codename WASD
learn enough SDK to make WASD
have full on eno
[#874.9] files marked as "LEGACY" should be seated or deleted

oh boy, creating issues with the most complicated imaginagble algorithm
the default report is top 10 open issues, VCS chronological order
maybe introduce CLI late in the game
maybe the "simple" VCS integration where you map a traversal through datestamps
maybe a config file or dotfile of several readmes. correct major issues in them
a simple single tag search (using tatsu but also with some fast cheat). data pipes?
traverse over the entities of a collection using your custom identifier
inject your custom identifier into kiss rdb collections
