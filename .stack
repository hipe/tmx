the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx])
reverse synchronization (or postpone)
recursive for CLI
recursive for API
recursive magnetics
CLI integration for single
-------
integration: solve a contrived problem with both (900-ish)
find a path: don't cycle, find shortest path, whine when not found (700-ish)
-------
ASSIMILATE MAGNETICS VIZ
CLI (testfile) (525)
for integration: token stream stream via directory object (testfile) (519)
dotfile graph via function index (mocked only) (testfile) (513)
function index (NO testfile) - needs (same) via collection (506)
