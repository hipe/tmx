the big question - slicer
factor out dir_pathname (!)
insane experment with [sa] - convert every `should eql` to etc and see diff
no more regret
(fix [#ca-xx] => [#co-xx], â€¢ in md's, `_call`=>`call`)
look into better intergration of dev (click on stack frames)
recursive for CLI
eliminate old doctest manifest file b.c all is new
every old [dt] test that requires shared setup
every old [dt] test that is easy (use and modify CLI for this as needed)

syncing issues-

./brazen/lib/skylab/brazen/cli-support/table/core.rb  "three tests" - "try syncing this"..
./brazen/lib/skylab/brazen/cli-support/option-parser/actors.rb  "simple as is but should be broken up" "also rename"
./basic/lib/skylab/basic/method.rb  "module as subject, too many tests in a row" "shared subject multiline"

maybe refactor these when done - have one or more smells/deeper issues -
./test_support/lib/skylab/test_support/sandbox.rb  (1 setup, 1 test)  NO TEST - NO USAGE? ASSET ISLAND?
./brazen/lib/skylab/brazen/cli-support/table/actor/field-strategies-/statistics/models--.rb  "type #caass, complicated as hell"  NEEDS RENAME
./parse/lib/skylab/parse/functions-/serial-optionals.rb  "type #caass"  NEEDS RENAME
./parse/lib/skylab/parse/functions-/alternation.rb "type #caass"  NEEDS RENAME
basic/lib/skylab/basic/function/core.rb needs rename ONLY
