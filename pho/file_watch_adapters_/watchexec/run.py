"""DISCUSSION we know we want these different adapters in different files
(modules), but we have ZERO idea what the interface should be. If we do ever
end up with multiple adapters for the different watch utilities, we find it
very likely that we see the .. architecture of this API change (in terms of
where the boundaries are and what the interactions are shaped like).

For now the API boundary is built on the kinds of interactions we want for
our one watcher (one where the client (not us) exec's out to a subprocess
though use of an ARGV and other hard-coded decisions), but it's unlikely
that the interaction would have these same properties for other watchers
(especially on other OS'es yikes)

"""NOTE nowhere in the mono-repo is it reflected that we have installed
`watchexec`: it's not in requirements.txt nor did we make an installer task.

The installation on OS X was entirely straightforward as pointed to

to this docuemntation on failure.
