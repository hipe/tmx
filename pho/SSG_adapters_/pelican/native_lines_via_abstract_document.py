"""DISCUSSION

This is a big giant rough sketch. The central point of it is to prove the
concept, to fill in this essential hole in the build pipeline, and to get
us writing and using the system.

We find it HIGHLY LIKELY that we will want to attempt at least most of
these refactorings down the road, but we didn't want to early abtrac them:

- One day if there's ever another SSG adapter, abstract out parts of this.
  This is sort of a proving ground for finding out what kind of facilities
  an SSG adapter would need.

- There are existing redundancies between this and the year old plus work
  of turning notecards into hugo (yikes) documents. It would be best to
  back-factor this new work into the old work, once this settles.
