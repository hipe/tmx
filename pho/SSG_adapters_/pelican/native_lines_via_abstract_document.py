"""DISCUSSION

This is a big giant rough sketch. The central point of it is to prove the
concept, to fill in this essential hole in the build pipeline, and to get
us writing and using the system.

We find it HIGHLY LIKELY that we will want to attempt at least most of
these refactorings down the road, but we didn't want to early abtract them:

- One day if there's ever another SSG adapter, abstract out parts of this.
  This is sort of a proving ground for finding out what kind of facilities
  an SSG adapter would need.
  (29 days later, it looks like no: we won't abstract anything lol)

- There are existing redundancies between this and the year old plus work
  of turning notecards into hugo (yikes) documents. It would be best to
  back-factor this new work into the old work, once this settles.
  (29 days later: again no)

    """
    A head notecard's heading is ANY non-empty string (assume). From the
    heading we get (directly??) the title as it appears in the *abstract*
    frontmatter. Now, *somehow* we get from the abstract frontmatter title to
    the actual frontmatter title in the outputted vendor markdown document.

    A basic fact of life for SSGs (and web in general) is that there are
    characters you might want in an on-screen title that you won't want in
    filesystem paths (and relatedly, url paths). The latter are composed of
    components called "slugs".

    Presumably every SSG has some function (exposed or emergent) that gets you
    from frontmatter title to filesystem entry (filename (just basename)).
    (In peloogan it's `util.slugify` plus settings.)

    The thing is, we need to be sure we know what filesystem entry (slug plus)
    extension) the SSG will derive from its frontmatter, because we use
    filesystem paths (not frontmatter titles) to specify which outputted html
    document we want to reload on. If the strings don't line up, we will
    silently fail to generate the final document.

    At first we prototyped a lengthy but robust "slugify" of our own, and then
    after the fact we pried into vendor internals to see how they did it.

    At writing, not sure what the end pipeline will be with respect to our own
    code vs theirs, but the point is we have to be able to know (beforehand)
    what slug the vendor will derive from our title, so we can request to
    output the correct document. See (Case3782) and maybe others nearby.
