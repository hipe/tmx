    firstly, note that this is ALL likely to be temporary.
    (we mean this WHOLE function :#here1.)

    that said, this undifferentiated chunky mass of code is towards 2
    problems. our description of the problems:

        1) we need to manage the allocation and cleanup of our "jobs"
           directory tree (basically just a tempdir with arbitrary depth).

        2) when we used to just run the app with this ðŸ‘‡ (#history-A.1),

               app.run(debug=True)

           we would get warnings that the socket wasn't closed down
           when we stopped the server with Ctrl-C.

    analysis of the problem: if (2) is already not happening as it should,
    (1) will be even more annoying and cludgy to address. also:

    (1) is primary, but if (2) is actually substantive and we can address
    that too, then maybe we can offer a patch to the lib one day..
    (in the time between when we started working on this with python 3.5
    to 3.6 (now), this may have been fixed. we're not sure yet.)

    so, our objectives:

        1) orchestrate the cleanup of our own facilities in concert
           with server start and stop.

        2) do what you have to do to get the the server to close that
           socket on normal server shutdown (and maybe even abnormal
           server shutdown too.) when you narrow down the problem,
           get rid of the cruft (in a latter commit).

    more analysis of the problem: the canonic call to `app.run` we replace
    (shown above) leads to a mostly "straight" "stack" of calls to wrapper-
    ish functions and methods. each line below represents one "frame" of
    this stack, where each line represents a call that calls each next line:

        (flask app) app.run [1]
        (werkzeug.serving) run_simple [2]
        (") make_server [3]
        (") serve_forever [4]
        [http.server.HTTPServer.serve_forever] [5]
        socketserver.TCPServer.serve_forever [6]

    notes about each frame of the stack (numbers in brackets are "pieces"):

    [1]: flask app.run: (host, port, debug, werkzeug_options). flask choses
         expected defaults for host and port and use_reloader and use_debugger

    [2]: werkzeug.serving.run_simple: (recognizes 15 parameters). this does
         a lot, including binding and listening. unfortunately this is also
         the problem area that we want to address XXX

    [3]: (") make_server: this is exactly factory pattern. we can probably
         un-abstract it, as long as we are using one process and one
         thread.. (but when not, we can probably call this function?)

    [4]: (") serve_forever: a thin wrapper that ensures `server_close`
         (which is an empty hook-in)

    [5]: serve_forever: super().

    [6]: socketserver.TCPServer.serve_forever: read the note here
         (near their XXX). it .. gives pause..
