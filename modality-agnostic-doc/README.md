# modality agnositc modeling

this is a relatively simple idea that has been developed elsewhere.

much of the requisite code is already in place, but needs to be re-housed
here from elsewhere.

this document exists as a placeholder to track the intention (wish)
of abstracting these assets in these terms, so that they can be referred
to.

always keep in mind this library can be kept very "pure" because it itself
does not have to worry about satisfying (directly) particular modalities,
only in modeling interfaces for this purpose.
