    """the #here1 adaptation for streams of pairs.

    imagine an iterator (we will say "stream" here) of name-value pairs. the
    target API we are implementing against accomodates both random-access and
    sequential traversal. (the platform language's _dictionary_ (which is
    ordered) is a familiar practical example of a collection that exposes an
    interface like this.)

    in effect, we want a stream of name-value pairs to "act like" an ordered
    dictionary. if you like, it's a "lazy" dictionary. this is how we do so:

    in the very beginning, whether we are doing a "retrieval" (given a key)
    or a traversal of all items; we must consume items off the source stream.

    for a retrieval, the source stream is traversed lazily, only as much as
    is necessary to find the association with the target key.

    as we enounter each new association during our traversal, we put this
    association *into* a dictionary that serves as a cache. (note the
    association is cached whether or not has the target key (if relevant).)

    if it's a traversal (not retrieval) that's being performed externally,
    we likewise place each encountered association in the cache. note too if
    the traversal is interrupted (like with a `break` because a certain
    needle is found), the internal traversal of the source stream is also
    halted (perhaps temporarily) there.

    all subsequent traversals and retrievals of the outward-facing fa√ßade
    will then consult the cache dictionary as appropriate to do traversals
    and retrievals from it before continuing to flush any remaining stream.

    in implementation how this works out is that we model the collection to
    be in one of two states internally (states that must be totally
    unknowable to outside clients): an "open" state and a "closed" state.
    when the internal stream has not yet reached the end, we are in an open
    state. once we find the end of the stream, we move to the "closed" state.
    (the closed state is much simpler because it's merely representing a
    dictonary *as* a dictionary, more or less.)

    considerations:

      - the internal cache/dictionary is in-memory so there are practical
        considersations against using this against large collections for some
        definition of. (redis would be neat here, but holy scope creep.)
        ([#410.R] (perhaps first mention)

      - just as a curious corollary, it's worth noting that if your
        retrievals always use existant keys and never do a full traversal,
        then internally the collection will always stay in the "open" state
        and never reach the "closed" state.

      - currently the "locking" we do for sanity might be costly at some
        scales.
