experimentally, an "index"

  - can be seen from three sides:
  - maybe as a bunch of lines
  - maybe as a hash
  - maybe as a B-tree

the way an index is made: traverse over the *sorted* identifiers,

with each next identifier,

    what is the integer distance between it and the previous identifier?

    take that number,
    take the "number of slots left in the line",
    if that number is zero:
        start a new line
    otherwise:
        place the new item in the line and update the "number of slots left .."

just kidding.

our index is an ordered series of identififiers:

    "ABC", "ABE", "ABF"

arranged as a tree-like structure in a file:

    A
     +-B
       +-C
       +-E
       +-F

but we squash the terminals into one line with its parent
(the list of terminals we call a "rack" in the code):

    A
     +-B (C E F)

also put blank spaces for placeholders for digits not yet used (holes):

    A
     +-B (C   E F)

and also the semantics of "indenting" are *negative* depth:


    (not like this:)
    +-----------------
    |A
    | B (C D)


    (like this:)
    +-----------------
    | A
    |B (C D)


or when deeper. at the unlikely depth of four:

    +--A
    |  +--B
    |  |  +--C
    |  |  |  +--D
    |  |  |  +--E
    |  |  +--F
    |  |     +--G
    |  +--H
    |     +--J
    |        +--K
    +--L
       +--M
          +--N
             +--P


it would be:

    (not like this:)
    +-----------------
    |A
    | B
    |  C (D E)
    | H
    |  J (K)
    |L
    | M
    |  N (P)


    (like this:)
    +-----------------
    |  A
    | B
    |C (D E)
    | H
    |J (K)
    |  L
    | M
    |N (P)


while writing the pseudocode and the head of this asset file, we changed
the format from what's there in in pseudocode to what was just described.

for reference, the original specification imagined lines something like this:

    AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB AXB XCB ..

now that we think about it, this has problems we didn't even consider at the
time; but at the time the main thing that bothered us was all the visual and
spatial redundancy of the more significant digits.

we considered using toml but didn't like the "impurity" of how shardings
would have looked there (really crazy).

for reference:

    .
     A
    B (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H J K L M N P Q R S T U V W X Y Z)
    C (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H J K L M N P Q R S T U V W X Y Z)

our current specification is optimized for these design objectives:

    - human readability: reduce visual noise by not repeating the
      the non-tail (more significant) digits.

    - version control austertity: if you push or pop levels of depth in your
      identifier (provisioning more space with a schema change), change to
      the file is minimized because of the mirror-image-ing of indenting.
      (this one is some real OCD fanservice.)

    - whitespace austertity: the "negative indenting" also reduces how wide
      the overall file is, because what are the widest line are always
      flush-left.

    - visually isomorphic for population density: because we line up
      the terminal digits each into their own column, you can see the
      holes visually, which is mostly just a novelty and debugging nicety.
