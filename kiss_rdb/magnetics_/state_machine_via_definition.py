"""Temporary Discussion of this module (at #history-B.4):

The conceptual homeland for all things "state machine" is in a different
package ("modality agnostic"), tracked [#504] (as a shadowy outline).

This, however, is the oldest physical file we've found dedicated to the cause.
The reason we haven't moved this file (and so module) from here to there is
only for lack of want of these particular facilities by any other applied use
case of state machines.

Indeed, our current favorite way to do state machines is merely a pattern,
rather than any particular classes/functions. The pattern is implemented
directly with plain old python code and eschews drawing in external code as
an added dependency and coupling.

(All the other ðŸ†’ ðŸ†• ways we've come up with between then and now are tracked
with an identifer already in this file: [#!008.2].)

(It also bears mentioning somewhere that the topmost facilities in this file
sort of resemble a flat map. The pattern seems to be: make a flat map that
produces an output stream from an input stream, internally using a state
machine. SO if we had to rename this file now we might call it
"flat map via state machine".)

BUT THEN: the mandate of this file gets more interesting: At this moment we
are creating an experimental new "case" facility. In the spirit of what we
just explained above, we don't want to commit the sin of early abstraction
and give "case" its own file yet. Except that there's support code for "case"
that is only used on a deviation from normal execution (error .. cases), and
we want that OUT of the asset code.

Now, "case" on its own feels like too small a mechanism to deserve its own
file, however: conceptually (or maybe just practially) "case" seems like a
fundamental, auxiliary component to any state machine. So we are comfortable
bundling the two in one file (and the client having to know that "case" is
conceptually subordinate to "state machine").

TL;DR: this file is home to "case" support for an imagined future where this
file goes to live in [ma] as a generic support module for all things "case"
and state machine (at which point most of this comment block should be removed)
