"""why this file is anemic:

ðŸ‘‰ The official home of the "producer script" format adapter is in
   "data-pipes". As such, this file should live there not here.

ðŸ‘‰ "data-pipes" is sub-ordinate to here: we want that the dependency is
   one-way: where this sub-project shouldn't depend on on that one.

ðŸ‘‰ But the below code violates that.

ðŸ‘‰ To do this "right" we would "mount" the other location

ðŸ‘‰ But for historical reasons (the two adapter "variants" we have for
   markdown files), rather than "mounting" we just do it "by hand" for now.
