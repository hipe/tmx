""":[#458.E] record mapping

convert an upstream dictionary stream (a.k.a "JSON stream") to a downstream
where certain transformations are performed on possibly each record in the
collection.

transformations are specified per field name (by far name) using the
supported "directives":

    - rename a field from its far name to its desired near name (`rename_to`)
    - specify how to derive the outputted cel string (`string_via_cel`)
    - split one field into two (or maybe many) (`split_to`)

(hypothetically you could apply multiple directives to one field.
generically this whole mess of fields and their directives is specified
under the "special field instructions".)
