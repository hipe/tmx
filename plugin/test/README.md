# numbering scheme

following [#ts-001], we came up with this ordering years (and years and
years) after most of these nodes were created. the regression order is fully
heuristic and partly arbitrary, based generally on a sense for how strong of
a dependency the overall "universe" has on the node (the stronger the
dependency, the lower the regression number).

  - 09:  2012-06-16  [#024] bundle (early because "fancy lookup" is essential
                     in most test trees) (nothing is covered because these
                     nodes were themselves abstracted from test trees, generally)

  - 26:  2017-01-08  filesystem-based - newest but seen as lowelevel because
                     of its future intended use by [sy]

  - 42:  2014-01-28  [#ta-004] because came after the rest (i dunno) (has no tests)

  - 66:  2017-02-15  xx

  - 75:  2012-08-02  [#010] delegation (less tests than dependency)

  - 92:  2012-06-19  [#007] dependencies
