# the autonomous component system

## brief introduction

"the ACS" is not so much a library in the traditional, object-oriented sense
but more a set of conventions you can opt-in to in a piecemeal way in
your classes; and a corresponding collection of library *functions*
(usually) that can do something interesting with participating objects.
