[#029]       [ stream via platform params ..]

[#028]       parameters normalize..

[#027]       this tracks two separate but related phenomena:

             specifically, the experiment of where a formal operation
             indicates as required (or maybe optional) parameter another
             formal operation (to mean its true-ish result) (a [ze] thing).

             more generally this is also used to track side-effects of
             (and hook-outs necessary for) formals that define their own
             parameter value readers.

             (if this breaks out into its own file, see comments this commit)

             :#A is custom execution of the [#fi-007] session, amounting
             to a system-private API. this tracks patterns near that.

[#026]       for now, if an association is `is_singular_of` another
             association, *by the storage implementation* (ivars)
             the singular form of actual value is stored in the storage
             location of the plural variant, after this singular value
             is "upgraded" to being one-length array.

[#023]       tracks places where the assumption is made that we are not
             long-running. if/when "long-running"-ness occurs for an
             application, these are areas that make calculations redudantly.
