# ("sand castle" ramblings)


## intro

a sand-castle is like a tumblr for presenting interactive infographics.

  • imagine different members of the community forking and and modifying
    each other's sand castles.

a sand-castle can be built from different "forms" provided by
the platform. (forms are like the "tools" of a Photoshopper's toolbox.)

one available form is a "cull table". [..] one possible side-effect of
building (and playing with) a cull table is that you can find
"hidden stories" in the data, like (EDIT).




## "requirements" & suggestions for our "table sort" (cull)

  • informatically (might be visually too)

    * (later) drag-move whole column to left or right (to re-order columns)

    * hide or show any column (see next supersection)

    * toggle sort between asc/desc (like wikimedia, but different design)

    * each column's "scalarizer" (sort criteria) has an XXX

    * for "enum-like" column "classifications" ..


  • visually (when not informatically)

    * no mouseover - imagine this is all touch

    * it would be nice if by default we styled these to look like
      a wikipedia table

    * hiding/showing columns needs design

  • implementation-wise,

    * as stated in previous section, we would like to use angular
    * notwithstanding above, consider that mediawiki (wikipedia) uses
      the "tablesorter" jquery plugin
