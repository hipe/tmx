# Objective & Scope

Our friends in the groupchat shared with us the existence of the [redbean][red1]
webserver. It made us wonder if it would be a possibly good solution for our
small internal tools.


# Immediate-term goals:

We should find out if we can use [popen][lua1] in the way we want:
  - We can't read stderr but we can encode/decode the equiv:
    for example each line starts with an 'O ' or an 'E '
  - Passing parameters to the subprocess is documented shadily..


# How we installed it:

(NOTE the "cap server 'start server' script" is now the definitive authority
on how we installed redbean. This below is left here because it may be easier
to read, but note that the version of redbean we are actually using is different
than below.)

Following a subset of [the installation instructions][red2]:

```bash
curl https://redbean.dev/redbean-latest.com.dbg > redbean.com.dbg
chmod ug+x ./redbean.com.dbg
```

(Again, see the server start script for better accuracy and completeness.)


# recfiles adaptation roadmap roadmap

(transcribed from phone)

1. Make a dummy tree with just a few items (as a test fixture).
Implicitly come up with the tree structure for "native capabilities".
1. Build script to render the whole capabilities tree as one big
html file. Plan to separate (or _do_ separate) nav from inner
content. Note this will hack the beginnings of a `select` query
adaptation for recfiles. Commit.
1. Build script to focus on one capability: render a "view entity"
page. Separate inner content from outer nav. Commit.
1. Without knowing the details of our data model yet, add the following
N dependencies, documenting their version we are using and exactly how
we installed it. Maybe as install scripts. probably yes.
1. Dependency: `sqlite3` the package on our OS.
1. Dependency: the simplest executable of redbean.
1. Commit the above N installation scripts/docs *along with* a lua
script endpoint that integrates the tree view and the node view. (Commit.)
1. Traverse the whole documentation of recfiles (avoid the urge to write
a scraper for this, do that later, doing it by hand will be a good exercise)
populating a large tree with just the terminal content node headers and
the nonterminal nodes, and their relationship (probably just a "chidren"
field). Assert that the big tree rendered as HTML looks good. Commit.
1. Each capability will get an "implementation roadmap" that is implied
by an "implementation status" and any comments. (It would be nice to avoid
comments maybe.) The comments are a data field, not recfile comments.
This in turn will develop our "abstract capabilities tree" which will at
first probably mimic closely the recfiles capability tree.
1. (Many commits). Adapt the N capabilities you need to adapt of recfiles,
updating each record appropriately lol


# (Appendix: for posterity, a road not traveled

These were items we wrote on our "stack". It's an interesting snapshot
for the reason that it gave us the realization that our "stack" system
sometimes suffers from the fact that it sort of reflects a "speculative
skill-tree": sometimes we can eliminate whole clusters of an imagined
sequence of requirements when a target requirements is false.

1. get & document luarocks
1. get luaposix
1. two-way communication with a subprocess (`popen3`)
