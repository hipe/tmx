the journey is the new way.

for example:

> of the path "Users",

> I am the persona "Application Developer",

> and my level is "Foundational".

here's the things:

  - path:
    - browse.
    - users:
      - personas: app-developer, cluster-operator
      - levels: foundational, intermediate, advanced
    - contributors:
      - personas: code-contributor, community-contributor, docs-contributor
      - [same levels]


## <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-journeys/users/application-developer/foundational">journey: application developer (foundational)</a>

  - usually a "cluster operator" is one job, and not something the developer
    does

  - random annoyance about this documentation: it's multiple doo-hahs
    ("I want to..") that all link to the same one document (on document
    per XXX)
