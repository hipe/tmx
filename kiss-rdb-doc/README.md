## objective & scope

a ridiculous
pipe dream
toy project: the
easy-to-understand
easy-to-work-with
ultra-light-duty
relational-ish
database-ish.

  - this is a toy project not suitable for production
  - data is stored in human-readable files (and directories)
  - files must be human-editable too
  - version control (like `git` or `hg`) will be used/abused for journaling

woah boy.
