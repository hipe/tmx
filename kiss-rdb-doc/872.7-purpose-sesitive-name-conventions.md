# Why (XX)

- "when in Rome, do as the romans do"
- it "just looks wrong"
- but also, we use slightly different wording for different for the same field
  in different contexts, with the same rational that it "feels better" this way
  and "just looks wrong" the other way


# Intro to terms

- "camel" and "snake" XX


# What

- For recutils, we try to follow the same naming conventions the examples
  in the docs show (camel)
- For the dataclass side, we use snake case per usual
- For HTML form parameters, we use the snake case of the store, which is not
  necessarily the same as the dataclass attribute name string.
  (E.g.: store: "Body", dataclass: "body\_lines", html form: "body")
