ðŸ‘‰ Use [the website][1] not [the github][2] for an intro.

ðŸ‘‰ We feel like reading all the docs cover-to-cover.

ðŸ‘‰ Looks like recfiles.


# some comments about interesting or counter-expectation stuff

ðŸ‘‰ It bothers me that the start of a fieldset looks like a no-value field.

ðŸ‘‰ PogChamp copying and modifying a fieldset!

ðŸ‘‰ The way you escape a `--` expression in a multiline field is by using
*more* dashes in the delimiter expression. (So if you were this
programmatically, add one to the longest doo-hah). Open question if it matters
if the in-string expression is anchored to the line head. Another open question
is whether the string is EOL-terminated (and if so, whether you can encode one
that is not).

ðŸ‘‰ Open question: how can you tell the difference between an empty list and
a null value?

ðŸ‘‰ "Empties" are interesting.

ðŸ‘‰ The one-line comment delimiter is ">".

ðŸ‘‰ "Associated Comments" (before the thing they comment, with no interceding
blank line).

ðŸ‘‰ Line continuations with "\". WHITESPACE PLAYS NO ROLE. Direct line
continuation with "|".

ðŸ‘‰ Recursive copy with "<<" instead of "<".
