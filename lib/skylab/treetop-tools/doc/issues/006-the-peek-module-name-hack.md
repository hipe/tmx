# the peek module name hack :[#006]

## introduction

this is an intense hack. it is an intense hack. scan the first few lines
of a file with a hand-written parser looking for what is the first class
or module defined in the file is, skipping over any comments. if you're
thinking you could do it with a regex, you're thinking it wrong. also,
all of this is wrong.


this implementation is a shameless & deferential tribute which, if
not obvious at first glance, is intended to symbolize the triumph
of the recursive buck stopping somewhere even if it perhaps doesn't
need to.  (i.e.: yes i know, and i'm considering it.)
