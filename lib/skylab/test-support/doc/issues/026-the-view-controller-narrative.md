# the templo narrative :[#026]


## :#storypoint-5 introduction

"templo" is a goofy name but we wanted it to be short, unique and semantic.
a "templo" holds all the ugly, hard-to read, and one-offy logic we need to
write partly because our templates are truly logic-less and partly because
what we're doing is so cool we need ad-hoc classes for it. Sure call it a
wiew controller but eew.



## :#storypoint-10

for now. `begin` means "set these (positional) parameters", and
"i might want to do more stuff - i.e hold on to the templo".
