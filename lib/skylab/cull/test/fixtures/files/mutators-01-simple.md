here is a minimal example of a hole in a table cel:

  | prog lang name | monads |
  | ---------------|--------|
  |           ruby |        |
  |        haskell |    yes |



in betrayal of the name of this file, here is the "ersatz catalyst case":
the respective sets of features are tracked for two candidates in a table
that grows downward with each additional feature. we represent that the
candidate "has" the feature in some way by entering anything nonblank
for the appropriate cel.

a "unique feature" report on the below table may bring this project to
backend complete.


  |  the feature              |  bike   | car |
  |  uses gas?                |  no gas |     |
  |  is it cheap?             |     yes |     |
  |  does it take you places? |     yes | yes |
  |  can you live in it?      |         | yes |
