# tactical table :[#003]

## introduction

this document complements the graph under the same number in a sibling
file. we tried to generate the below data procedurally (and we did) but
some human intervention is necessary to come up with a linear roadmap
from it all.




## rough high-level roadmap

  • G.U CLI 1/3 [po]
  • G.U CLI 2/3 [hl]
  • G.U CLI 3/3 [fa]
