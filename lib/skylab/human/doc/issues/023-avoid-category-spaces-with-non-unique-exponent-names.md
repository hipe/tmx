# avoid category-spaces with non-unique exponents :[#023]

if there exist two exponents with the same names but in different categories,
they are different exponents. but to avoid confusion, we recommend that you
avoid making category-spaces with non-unique exponents without good reason:

for fun, and because it's our favorite source of examples, here is a
didactic excerpt of the `category-space` of grammatical
categories as wikipedia knows it (i.e. non-comprehensive):

(categories appear as the leftmost term, and their respective exponents
are enumerated in the parenthesis immediately following in a compressed,
"pseudo-BNF" form)

(what we should do is cull this down to just english for its purpose)

  agency ( agent, patient )

    (interesting notes here)

  animacy: it is not stated in these terms, but they make a case for
    animacy being a continuous as opposed to discrete category. WAHOO

  aspect (woah)

  case ( nominative, accusative, dative, ablative, genitive, vocative,
         locative, insturmental )

  clusivity ( inclusive, exclusive )

  comparison ( positive, comparative, superlative )

  definiteness ( indefinite, definite )

  evidentiality : hm..

  focus: very interesting

  gender ( masculine, neuter, femine )

  mirative: loose, disputed

  modality: wow neat

  mood ( realis ( indicative ),
         irrealis ( subjunctive, conditional, imperative, jussive, potential ),
         other ( interrogative ) )

       ( an interesting note here: "in Japanese it is often called something
         like tentative, since potential is used to refer to a voice
         indicating capability to perform the action")

  noun class: not for english

  number ( singular, plural )

  person: it is tempting to break this up into finer categories

  polarity ( affirmative, negative )

  tense ( present, [ [im]perfect | relative ] past, [relative] future  [..] )


  topic-comment: interesting - no exponents .. further study required!

  transivity: wikipedia's description of this is so relevant to trajectory
    of study that we had to skip it for now.


  voice ( active,
          [{ anti | { dynamic | static } }-]passive,
          middle, causative, reciprocal, cooperative. )

  valency ( impersonal, [{ in | di }-]transitive )

the point is simply: note how infrequently the exponents are repeated
in this category-space.
