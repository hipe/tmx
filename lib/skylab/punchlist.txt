"sub-tree"          q [ TODO ]

  • subject only depended on [fa] for "table",
  • so we were like "let's get [fa] table out of [fa]"
  • which blew up into pre-unifying table
  • which blew up into sunsetting [mh]
  • also, one table wanted plugin, so pre-unify plugin ..


  SO:

    • p.u plugin (1/N): [hl] (1 & 2)
    • p.u plugin (2/N): [fa]

    • p.u table (1/4): minimal (1 & 2)
    • p.u table (2/4): inferential (1 & 2)
    • p.u table (3/4): structured (1 & 2 )





  all tables now live under [#ba-096]:

    fa-048 (simple) => A
    fa-036 (actor)  => B
    hl-005 (inferential) => C
    fa-011 (structured) => D
