# Unobtrusive Lexical-esque Insertion :[#067]

(the following is the definition of #doc-point #067.)


The idea is this:

When you have a thing that you are going to insert into a list of
things, it would be nice to put in the list in the right place
alphabetically. However, if the list isn't sorted to begin with,
then you don't want to go and resort the list -- that would be rude.
In such cases, try and make it look like you were trying to do the
right thing and insert the item above the first item that you find
that was lexically greater ("should come after") the new item.
