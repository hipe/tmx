# the actor dream :[#066]

## the idea

this is the new dream of unification.


## :#note-70

the use of the word `with` at the end of a method name is reserved
exclusively for methods that take as arguments literal iambics.
typically the method named `with` itself (with nothing else before it)
either mutates the receiver or dupes, mutates and freezes; resulting in
either self or the dup respectivey. in this case the result is the
result of the actor's execution. we make this exception from the
convention because it reads better, given that actors are recommended to
be named after verb phrases.



## :#note-80

this is all hugely experimental, but for now actors are assumed to be
named like local procs, that is:

    class Verb_noun_etc_etc__  # ..
