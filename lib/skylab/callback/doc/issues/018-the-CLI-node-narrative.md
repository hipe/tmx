# the CLI node narrative :[#018]


## introduction

this node is not related to the host sidesystem in its capacity as a
sidesystem.

this is an experimental utility for generating visualizations of event
stream graphs *from* participating clients of the pub-sub event model.

for typical day-to-day users of the host sidesystem this node can be ignored.
