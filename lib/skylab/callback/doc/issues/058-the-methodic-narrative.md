## introduction

who cares about history. it's the hero we deserve, and the one we need
right now.

(from the original, business location)

ya know it's funny i really gotta tell ya somethin', we hate writing
and re-writing this same kind of normalization logic for every
application (nil out ivars, apply defaults, whine about missing
requireds), but the alternative (so far) has been the bloated and obtuse
[cb] entity property hooks API. hand-writing these 20 lines each time
may just be worth the cost savings.

also we could just push this method itself upwards..
