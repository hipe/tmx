# the range narrative :[#035]

## introduction

at this time there are two nodes under this one: "positive" and
"normalize". they are years apart, both useful, and both distinct.

one day we will proto-fit the old to the new range class.


## reasons to build a custom range class

+ the native range class does not natively represent unbound positive and
  negative numbers

+ the native range doesn't let you stuff arbitrary objects into its
  components

+ mutable ranges can be useful for hackery, perhaps
