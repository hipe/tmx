## about this story

the only purpose of this story is to play with [#006] the flattening
experiment (see). the matrix is supposed to look something like this:

                          1  2  3  4  5

                  file1      X  X     X
                  file2      X     X  X
                  file3   X        X

we will continue this discussion in [#006].
