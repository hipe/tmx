# introduction

something we hint at in [#012] but don't elucidate is how we sort the
commits. the way we do this currently is theoretically "pure" but very
costly in practice.

we would see perhaps a 5x speedup if we just used the datetime stamps of
the commits to determine (\*) their sequence, rather than how we do it
currently.

this will take work and is not a blocker.
