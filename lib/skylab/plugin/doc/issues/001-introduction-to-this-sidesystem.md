# introduction to this sidesystem :[#001]

## meta-introduction

the immediate reason that [pl] was created was to be a more focused,
dedicated sidesystem for the somewhat ancient bundle- and plugin-related
"leftover scraps" from [mh] as it was dissolved: we wanted to get rid of
[mh] proper, but some of facilities were still needed by some legacy
applications.

but when we moved [#024] the "fancy lookup" proc to here, [pl] became an
essential member of The Pantheon of skylab support libraries.  as such ..




## .. into the near future ..

[pl] will hold *all* plugin facilites universe-wide, including imporant
ones that are not here yet.




## where are the tests?

the old bundle facilities were frequently either abstracted out of
working applications with their own test coverage, *or* were implemented to
help implement tests themselves. so sadly, as this became its own formal
thing, it did not have its own formal tests that travelled with it.
