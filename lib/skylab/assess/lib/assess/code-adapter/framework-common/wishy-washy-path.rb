        #
        # The point of a wishy-washy path is to represent the relevant
        # nodes in the filesystem in an abstract way so that the actual
        # filepath isn't determined until runtime.
        #
        # After building this i realized we probably should have subclassed
        # Pathname, because the concerns are similar.  But all things being
        # equal I don't know how much of a gain that would be at this point.
        #
        # These facilities are provided to this end:
        # 1) paths can be represented as relative to other paths in
        #    the usual way.
        # 2) Depending on how it is constructed, a wishy-washy path can
        #    indicate that it might represent a file or a folder, to
        #    be determined at runtime. (use path.might_be_folder = true)
        # 3) Depending on if the path.might_be_plural=true option is used,
        #    the path can indicate that it may or may not have an 's' after it
        # 4) with the might_have_extension='.rb' option, it indicates that
        #    the actual path may or may not use the extension.
        #
        # So, something like this:
        #
        #   root_path = WishyWashyPath.new{|p| p.absolute_path = './app'} #sic
        #   cont_path = WishyWashyPath.new do |p|
        #     p.relative_to = root_path
        #     p.relative_path = './controller'
        #     p.might_be_plural = true
        #     p.might_be_folder = true
        #     p.might_have_extension = '.rb'
        #   end
        #
        #  Now, if any of the following paths exist the path object when
        #  'resolved' will find it (in some undefined order):
        #
        #  ./app/controller/
        #  ./app/controller
        #  ./app/controllers
        #  ./app/controllers/
        #  ./app/controller.rb
        #  ./app/controllers.rb
        #
        #  You can get the resolved path of a pretty path with
        #        p.pretty_path_resolved
        #        p.absolute_path_resolved
        #
        #  pretty_path tries to use './' when possible
        #
        #  If none of the permutations is a path that exists on the
        # filesystem, one of them will still be returned (which one is
        # undefined) . use exists? to see if the path exists.
        #
