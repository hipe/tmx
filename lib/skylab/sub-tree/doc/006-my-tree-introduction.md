# My Tree

Some reasons for this:

  + We wanted to see if we can make a full cannonical CLI with H-eadless (1.1)
  + We want trees with linecounts etc like we were doing before manually


Some Facets of this:

  + We could have built it under cov-tree
  + We could have built it under file-metrics


Reasons we didn't build it as part of existing products are:

  + the usual "fresh-start" motivation, dovetailing with 1.1 above
  + emotionally, we were especially in need of some "fresh-start" feeling
