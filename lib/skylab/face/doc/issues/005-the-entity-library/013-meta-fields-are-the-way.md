# getting into the meta-fields rabbit hole..

meta-fields can open up your life to a whole new world of salvation.
meta-fields can save you.

the hacky way (currently) that your API action can tap into the glorious
bounty of meta-fields is by calling the `params` "class method" and
passing a tuple (an array) as the first argument.

then you need expend no more effort ever.
