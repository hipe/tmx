# introducing the entity library

it is yet another redux of the same old thing, but might be kind of

the funny thing about this is it currently lives (what code yet exists
of it) in code molester because of reasons. but we (somewhat
arbitrarily) have chosen Face to be the host the entity-level
controller automation.
