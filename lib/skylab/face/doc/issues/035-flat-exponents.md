# flat exponents .. metastories :[#035]

it may look and feel really awful, but giving some of the controller nodes
a simple "type"-like symbol (a "flat exponent") mitigates the number of
trivial moving parts we have to add when creating (modality sensitive)
enhancements -- that is, it makes them much easier to implement!

## then this turned into metastories..
