# approaching a pattern langauge for semantic structures

this is random and disjoint for now.

the wikipedia page on "categorization" is awesome, as is the one on "conceptual
clusering". we are *certain* we will delve more deeply into this when we come
back around.

but for now, the local indirect goal of this doc node is to get to specifying
the API with a pattern langauge that we can get to from here.

## semantic structures?

first, just for fun we like the idea of talking about the patterns of semantic
structures rather than semantic structures themselves.

this lets us avoid defining `semantic structure` :[#004] (`concept`?) and
instead lets us focus on `patterns of behavior` :[#005] that we can then
associate with an imaginary semantic structure, that either exists or doesn't
exist.

more later..

## let's use `node` as a placeholder concept

when we first set out to introduce a simple, coherent lexicon for our semantic
(data) structures, we leaned on the word "node" as an apt all-purpose term to
mean "some data" (whatever it is).

the fact that neither the wikipedia page on "data structures" nor the one on
"information theory" had one mention of this term - a term we present as
foundational - bodes either well or poorly for whatever it is we are doing
here. ("node" does at least appear in the pages for "graph theory" and for
"list of data structures", however obliquely.)

(a note on style: when we have a block of text where each line is indented with
exactly 2 spaces, that block usually corresponds with one or more loose
definitions, usually defining the first term in that block that occurs quoted
with `backticks`. for example:)

  `node` - we are afraid to offer too formal a definition of it. rather we will
  just say that a `node` refers to a subset of all the information at a
  particular moment (HA), when it is useful to treat that subset of information
  as a discrete unit separate from other discrete units, which we may also
  refer to as `nodes`. `node` is necessarily the most general term we may ever use
  in this whole conceptual universe. :[#006]

  to piggyback on our limited understanding of "conceptual clustering", this
  `node` we speak of may be referring to a `concept`, `class`, `cluster`, or
  `object`; all of these, none of these, or some other subset therein; we
  really don't know yet. sorry.  (COBWEB, Fisher 1987)



## n-meta categorizations

one day when we have read all the books and journal articles, we will have an
optimal definition of `categorization`, but for now we must settle for defining
it ourselves, just for the sake of getting somewhere from here now.

let's build it up in steps. unfortunately we must use words to define other
words so it can get tricky.

:[#007] (pending)

`N-meta-categorization` :[#008] (pending)

`exponent` :[#009]

`discrete` vs `continuous` as `continuity` :[#010]

`binary` :[#011]

`discrete binary categorization` :[#012]

`universal` :[#013]
