# the collection controller narrative :[#026]


## introduction

for now this is low-level API documentation, that stands as a reminder
and central hub of what the conventions are for the the collection
controller in terms of the names, name patterns, and general patters of
its interface.




## general conventions

â€¢ arguments are passed in volatility order, with most volatile (likely to
  change from call to call) towards the beginning (done for two reasons
  explained elsewhere) with one exception:

  an event receiver (if any) must always go at the end.

we will try to make our "holes in the wall" (see below) correspond to the
HTTP verbs as much as is useful. (see below)
