> me: i'm thinking of attempting as my first scala project something like a webcrawler. (i want a webcrawler for a pet project of mine, i wrote a pretty hefty one in ruby years ago BUT webcrawlers of all things are a good use case for being multi-threaded, and i don't think ruby/python solutions are a clean choice for operating with concurrency SO it's a good excuse to start learning scala).
