# the find expression adapter for en :[#019]

this is an imperative (as opposed to declarative) implementation
of :+[#sg-025]: under this modality we express our native data
structure as natural-esque-sounding phrase (a "phrasal noun
modifier" maybe?) through the hand-written logic below.

the longer-term goal of efforts under that classification is that
expressions like these are produced procedurally as a product of
more declaractive structures like near [#sg-029]. the below hand-
written code is a "reference sketch" intended as a means to that
end. (because, we can write ad-hoc conditional logic that outputs
"EN" until our fingers turn blue -- it doesn't meant we have
taught the machine "how to express itself" in any scalable way).

more specifically to the detail of this modality, it is not
represented anywhere in data (yet) but the constraint of this
expression is that it must work to modify a noun by (in EN) being
placed after the noun. each unit that is placed into the toplevel
structure resulted by the expression should be something like a
prepositional phrase.
