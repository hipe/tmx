# conventions and style  :[#006]

a note on style: the variety of conventions on display below is like the
rings of a very old tree (born dec, 2010). on an as-needed basis during
maintenence we clean some of it up. remaining characteristics that we
might like to change that we have not yet:

  • single-entry single-exit and other debugging-friendly conventions

  • [#bs-030] modern name conventions for modules, methods, ivars
