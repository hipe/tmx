# what is the deal with this file?

## why it exists

we do not want multiple server (or other) processes trying to read from
job trees as they are in progress (unless we mean to); or having other
processes trying to write to, delete, or move job trees while they are
in progress.

our sort of quick-and-dirty solution to this is to have a single file
that we use to indicate that a process (the server) is using this entire
directory. (no, it appears that you cannot lock an entire directory
reliably.)

as such,

  - this file exists so that the server can vie for a read-only lock on
    it (and most importantly, will fail if we forget that another server
    process is already using it).

  - this file is opened for reading but it is never read from.

  - this read-only lock trick will only work with participating processes,
    so do not consider it reliable. (it might be the case that this we
    are only safeguarded from running multiple instanes of our own server,
    but that is OK.)




## why is it in version control

both so:

  - it makes installation straightforward (so that users don't have to
    create this file.)

  - so that its parent directory is creates as part of a project checkout.

  - (permissions might be an issue down the road..)
