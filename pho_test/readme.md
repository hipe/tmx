## numbering scheme

This imgained scheme is absurdly optimistic but whatever. The utopian
ideal is that every test case has a number within the range appropriate
for the modality or level of abstraction.

We have 8 categories and 9999 integers so rather than divide evenly we
gave more allocation to the two we will put the most nearterm work into
because why not.

EXPERIMENTALLY for the first time we are going to try to have all of the
test directory numbers, test file numbers *and* case numbers all exist on
the same number scale. (So each test file will have a number that is
*somewhere* within the range of test case numbers it's responsible for.)

This may trigger OCD that test file numbers are no longer distributed in
a full-width to their local directory, but that's okay.

OCD is preventing us from bumping up to 4 digits for now. (10 thousand
spots sounds like too many.)
