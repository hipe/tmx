## Synopsis

Given the "after" file and a patch file expressing "the" changes to that
file, produce two lists of "classifed lines" (conceptually).



## Justification and patch theory

Context diffs are the patch lingua-franca (with good reason); but they do
not quickly answer the question "Does this given line I'm on right now have
changes (or the boundary above it or below it)?".

An "after" file and its patch file imply *four* files: the two just mentioned,
and also a "before" file and finally the reverse patch file (that is, a patch
that gets you *from* the "after" file *to* the "before" file).

Given an "after" file and the patch that got it there, we produce *two*
"expanded" patch files: one forward and one reverse.

An "expanded" patch file is the patch file coupled with its referant file:
It's a series of "runs", each run representing a continuous â€¦ run of ZERO
or more lines in the referent file, and that run's corresponding instructions:
either "replace_lines" or "no_change". "replace_lines" has ZERO or more
accompanying lines to be used in the replacement.

A "replace_lines" run that stipulates a zero-with range of lines in the
referent (e.g "from start offset 7 to stop offset 7") and nonzero replacement
lines; this is how you express "insert lines".

Conversely, if you model a "replace_lines" run that has a nonzero run of
lines in the referent, and zero lines in the replacement; this is in effect
"delete lines".

With these two resultant "expanded patch" files, we have the lines of the
before file coupled with a forward patch, and the lines of the after file
coupled with the reverse patch, which we want for reasons. (Our designation
of one being "before/forward" and the other being "after/reverse"; these
designations are are purely pragmatic. Both are structurally of the same
types and have the same capabilities.)
