# the freetags feature :[#027]

(EDIT: this document is all +#archival. the simplified [#007] replaces this.)


.. would be that in the manifest you would write whatever tags you want
that aren't in the set of recognized fields, and they would be treated as
"free tags" that would be simple name-value pairs (or just flags, hm, maybe
we use the '=' here). NO! i got it: we use actual hashtags, and their syntax.
then these 'freetags' which can be queried by the guys.
