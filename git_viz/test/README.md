## numbering scheme

  - 10's     private models
  - 20's     private magnetics (see #here1)
  - 30's     public models
  - 40's     public magnetics
  - 50's     operations (via API)
  - 60's     niCLI
  - 70's     iCLI
  - 80's     w
  - 90's     i


### notes
  - :#here1: we have shoehorned VCS adapters into the middle of this
    number subspace because they depend largely on private magnetics.
    note too that *other* private magnetics in turn depend on the results
    of assets *there*, so we see three subnodes in this number subspace.
