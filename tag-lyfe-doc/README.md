# tag lyfe

## objective & scope

  - Ã  la twitter, imagine a collection that is marked up with "ordinary" tags:

    1. `tweet one - #metoo #basta`
    1. `what a great game #fifa2018`
    1. `rose mcgowan #metoo autobiagraphy ðŸ˜­âœŠ #fierce`

  - we can search for all items that have one particular tag, but also
    we can make more complicated boolean queries based on the taggings.
    a minimal example is in the [next section](#status).

(oblique snippet that will be moved to somewhere like `filter_by_tags.py`:
this is for making informed decisions, and then later being able to
justifying how you made those deicisions in a straightforward, reproducible,
machine-readble way.)




## <a name=status></a>status

this subproject currently works and is useful. combined with the power of
[\[#400\]] sakin-agac, this thing can take collections of items we're
tentatively calling "dim sum" tables (like in [\[#404\]], sort of) and pare
them down to match criteria (your "query").


for example:


    ./script/filter_by.py '#open' and not '#boring' tag-lyfe-doc/README.md


the above pares down the below [node table][#nt] (in this same document)
and ouputs (at writing):

    {"id": "#709.D", "main_tag": "#open", "content": "integrate queries and .."}
    {"id": "#709.C", "main_tag": "#open", "content": "maybe don't walk (#when)"}
    ..

i.e, it pares down the below collecton to filter it down to only those items
that are tagged with `#open` and not tagged with `#boring`.

the output is expressed as a stream (in the UNIX sense) of JSON objects
(where each line is one object) making it suitable to be piped into or
consumed by arbitrary other processes.
