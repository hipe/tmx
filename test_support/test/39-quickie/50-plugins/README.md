# about the numbering scheme for quickie plugins

at writing there are about ~10 plugins but of course we want this number
to flex arbitrarily (and boy wouldn't it be great if there were plugins in
different gems that we could mount). anyway if we were to use the
numberspace of only 100, that would give us only 10 integers of span
(wait, 9?) between entries, which would get overcrowded after only two
or so subdivisions between entries; so we're increasing the numberspace
by 10x and going with a numberspace of 1000.
