# about the regression weights near quickie

  - the quickie standalone file has a much earlier regression priority.
    its test node lives outside of the node this file documents.

  - the quickie plugins are much later, intentionally being housed right
    next to and just under "slowie", because we would like maybe one day
    for slowie to utilize some quickie plugins directly (as in, just use
    the classes, not call the API) (or maybe yeah do that instead..)
