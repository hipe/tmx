  # the bootstrapping problem here is obvious. GÃ¶del would have
  # something to say about this..

  # ordinarily, if r.s has been loaded by the time the subject loads,
  # it in effect disables itself. however in the below tests we want
  # always to be testing against our own `should` method and not that
  # of r.s. to this end we instead make this method called `shld` and
  # that is what we test against. in this manner you can use r.s to
  # run these tests (or the subject if the subject isn't broken.)
