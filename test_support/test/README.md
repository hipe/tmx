this is the rationale for the regression order of the toplevel nodes -

  - core test support functioning (#10)

  - magnetics (#20)

  - non-magnetic library nodes (not in subsequent categories)
    - IO spy (#30)

  - recursive test support functioning (#40)

  - expectation libraries (at toplevel)
    - expect stdout sterr (#50)

  - things that could perhaps become their own gems (2)
    - file-coverage (#60)
    - permute (#70)

  - "hard to test" (2)
    - cover (#80)
    - servers (#90)
