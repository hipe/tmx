# what is tmx? :[#001]

## synopsis

testing and metaprogramming experiments. a perpetual work in progress
towards something wonderful.




## introduction

"tmx" is a mostly meaningless "fake-croynm" that was chosen as a name
mostly because it sounded cool, and was impossible to mis-hear or
mispronounce.

as a point of fact, it was at first a command-line-friendly shortening
of the name "trackmarks", a name in turn that was chosen for its own
reasons.

an appropriate back-formation of its origin as an acronym, however, is
available as "Testing and Metaprogramming eXeriments". but meh.




## what is tmx here?

in the context of the diaspora before you, "tmx" is an "feature branch"
whose only purpose is to glue together other such branches.
