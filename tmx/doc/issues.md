[#004]       syntax for the "map" operation
[#003]       the help screen narrative ..
[#002]       what is the front model? ..
[#001]       "the problem with tmx" is where it hard-codes assumptions about
             a full or particular constituency of non-essential sidesystems..
             this applies to files in [tmx] and out, including data files/
             development guidance files (like the punchlist, like the
             greenlist), test code files (like the two in [tmx] that tests
             universe-wide integration), and any asset code files (none
             come to mind at the time).
