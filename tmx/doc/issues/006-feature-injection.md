# the glue that binds these central functions together :[#006]

the primary function of [tmx]  (the sidesystem) is to expose a "mapping"
function that gives reflection over whatever nodes happen to be in tmx
(the ecosystem) in such a way:

  - where the representation of this metadata is de-centralized and stable
  - that is adapatble to arbitrary different development environments and
  - that can be extended trivially with arbitrary new meta-data formal attributes.


the primary functions of [ts]'s "slowie" are represented in its collection
of test- and test-reporting-related operations.
