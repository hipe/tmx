[31;1mDESCRIPTION[0m
The [31mtmz tmx xargs-ish-i[0m utility is hacked, pared-down, stupid-simplified goof-off one-off inspired by [31mxargs[0m (see!) that, for each line of [4mfile[0m, builds the command produced by substituting-in that line for [4mreplstr[0m in the command template created by [4mutility[0m [4margument[0m [[4m...[0m], and for each such command gives you a "yes/no" prompt letting you decide whether or not to execute that command.

The "option" is as follows:

     [31;1m-J[0m [4mreplstr[0m
             The first occurence of [4mreplstr[0m in your command string ([4mutility[0m [4margument[0m [[4m...[0m]) will get replaced with each line (chomped) from [4mfile[0m.
