    # :[#022.4]: terminal associations (building off ideas in [#doc])
    #
    # Overview:
    #
    #   - the idea of & utility behind "terminal node" (a "leaf node") is
    #     essential to graph theory, grammars.
    #
    #   - here we use the concept to model the end-of-the-line, primitive
    #     data of AST's (things like integers, strings and so on.)
    #
    #   - we use the concept of terminals because A) they model the
    #     tendencies of the target grammar as it appears in practice and
    #     B) our [#025.F] traversal algorithm (as probably all of them)
    #     depends on knowing which nodes are terminal vs. nonterminal.
    #
    #   - terminal assocations require a terminal type. there are no
    #     built-in terminal types. they are always user-defined.
    #
    #   - currently, the "any" modifier cannot modify any terminal
    #     association, but we can change this if ever needed.
    #
    #   - as of #history-A.2, the full suite of [#022.G] plural arities can
    #     be used with terminal associations.
    #
    # Preface:
    #
    #   - if you have any familiarity with the association grammar, the
    #     below description might seem overblown. but note that the below
    #     was synthesized before the association grammar even existed. so,
    #     you can then see traces of its beginnings here.
    #
    # Story and initial requirements
    #
    #   - story: imagine searching a document AST for every node of type
    #     `send` whose method name is a specific symbol (or string; the
    #     distinction is meaningless here). in order not to fall over on a
    #     large document (or a large number of documents), we do not want to
    #     wrap every single AST node (or even every single AST node of the
    #     type of interest) into its grammar symbol class just to find the
    #     node(s) we are looking for.
    #
    #   - requirement via design consequence: maintain a hard-coded mapping
    #     of an association name (in our case `method_name` (an arbitrary
    #     business name we chose in our grammar adaptation)) TO a specific
    #     "hard offset" that can be used to dereference the child of interest
    #     from every AST node of that given type (in our case, type `send`).
    #     huh? for AST nodes of type `send` as they are handed to us, the
    #     method name happens to be at offset `1`. somehow we need to derive
    #     this integer from the symbol `method_name`.
    #
    #   - corollary requirement: in the case of grammar symbols that have
    #     formal children with plural arities, the "hard offset" can in
    #     theory be a negative number (to count from the end of the array
    #     of children). HOWEVER the offset can never point to a child that
    #     is part of the plural arity region of the children array. i.e an
    #     association with a plural arity cannot be componentiated. if this
    #     makes no sense to you, you can safely ignore it.
    #
    # Design consequences & other details
    #
    #   - in the very old days before the child association grammar, we
    #     created "components" which was markup you added to a grammar symbol
    #     class to point to *particular* *offsets* of the actual children by
    #     name.
    #
    #   - then the "structure Ã¼ber alles" overhaul brought us an expressive,
    #     concise grammar a side benefit of whose was that a wrapped form
    #     of every child was accessible by name; no longer just those under
    #     associations specially marked as "component". in contrast, this
    #     made the "old way" appear as an obscure, hard-to-read API
    #     (which can be seen in the asset code that served this test file
    #     in the state immediately before #history-A.1).
    #
    #   - this kicked us into an existential quandry of exactly what a
    #     "component" is. in its received state, two salient characteristics:
    #     1) they were "writable" 2) they were terminal.
    #
    #   - since these components as they had been written were more correctly
    #     named "terminals", we have made this rename but note that this
    #     writability has carried along with it for now.
    #
    #   - as such this new synthesis makes the sensical (but not fully
    #     powerful) provision that currently you can only mutate terminal
    #     nodes (really, just dup-and-mutate)
