# the problem with functions :[#013]

everyone probably knew this already, but the problem with functions,
as opposed to methods, that i did not appreciate unil *just* *now*,
is that methods are intrinsically more extensible..

(#open [#047]: get rid of this - whatever profound insight this represented
is lost to the sands of time.)
