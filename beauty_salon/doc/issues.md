[#046] #open remaining CLI/API (UI) issues with #crazy-town

[#045] #open we have no intention of making #crazy-town platform language
             complete until quite a ways later. our current intention is
             to get it to work for our own corpus as a refactoring tool.
             when we publish this we will strive for some kind of "completeness"

             a finishing point of this *might* be (in a single commit) to
             sunset all references of ~"what we used to do in the old days"

[#022]       mainly, this is to track the document about declared, structural

             that one file to *complement* (not redund) with the main file.

       #open [#here.E] tracks future places to refactor-in (see document)

             [#here.G]: whether or not "branchiness" should be markup in the
             grammar. that this is a const and not a method is because it's
             20% faster.
             (see also #this-commit message)

      #note [#here.F]: factory pattern is unofficial; clunky.

             [#here.E]: (needs a better home) the main mapping challenge
               this is not just the stuff about plural associations, but
               about whether we will ever support arbitrarily prioritized optionals.

             [#here.D]: the provision that we assert the many things we assert
             of our formal grammar against the actual AST node (tree). things
             like: arity, group, terminal type. (summary: it has a cost but we
             see it as justified to sanity-check our model (grammar))

             [#here.C]: design decision: reports are simple magnetics, not actions
