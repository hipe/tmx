# the skylab "beauty salon" utility

## objective & scope

"beauty salon" [bs] is a general dumping ground for ideas and code that
is concerned with beautification (or other programmatic alteration) of
code. since "search & replace" became its own sidesystem, the main
useful assets of "beauty salon" at this moment are the documentation
about name conventions that it holds.

i basically just wanted refactoring tools that were smart enough to know
the difference between like, variables and everything else. it would be
nice if there was an opensource API for these kind of refactoring tools -
just like .. i dunno i want to know how it does it. how does it parse ruby

i just want like a raw-ass lexical representation of a file for static
analysis. i know this is what rubymine is doing but i suspect they hack
it, like use the C code thatâ€™s generated by lexx and yacc from the ruby
sources or something
