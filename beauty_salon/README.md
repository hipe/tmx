# the skylab "beauty salon" utility

## objective & scope

"beauty salon" [bs] is a general dumping ground for ideas and code that
is concerned with beautification (or other programmatic alteration) of
code. although it is very built out and has a long history, we don't use
it for much except the occasional complex search & replace operation,
and as a repository for notes & ideas.

"search & replace" is important because it is the only utility to use
the "zerk" interface engine ([br]).
