## intro

as we write this there are at least 3 other solutions out there in our
universe (now all tagged with the subject identifier). the main reasons
we are starting anew with this node rather than trying to repurpose any
of the existing ones are:

  • some of the existing solutions were somewhat or very ad-hoc, being
    tailor-made for the specific needs of the application.

  • never before (in *our* universe) has a state-machine-like solution
    been written from the ground-up expressly to be a general purpose
    facility.

  • we can go back and try to re-distribute this out to one or more of
    the existing such places, operating under the informed assumption
    that this will have a more positive net-effect than trying to retro-
    fit existing solutions to fit our needs now: if we start fresh and
    write exactly what we need now (knowing what we needed then) we are
    informed by the past without being encumbered by it as well.
