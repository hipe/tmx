[#061]       :"diminishing pool": (this entry is for tracking and describing
             a commmon pattern. it has no dedicated asset node in this library.)

             a "diminishing pool" is or has the characteristics of a hash
             that gets smaller over time, typically because when an element
             of that hash is accessed, it also removed.

             when we use this pattern we typically use it to assert any of:

               - that each element is only accessed at most once

               - that at the end of the "invocation" (for whatever definition
                 of) that none of the elements remain in the pool.

               - in order to see what elements remain in the pool after some
                 operation, to do something with them.
