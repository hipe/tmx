    # this node is being kept here as a connection to its sizeable past
    # and as a placeholder for any possible future, however: when we came
    # around to assimilate this work for the great "one ring" unification
    # of [fi] normalization, we discovered that *all* of the work in this
    # file was a feature island, and was embarassingly legacy in its code
    # style.
    #
    # because all code is a liability, we decided it was best to just
    # remove the body of this node; and if ever a time arises that we wish
    # we had a "set" node that did anything similar to what this used to
    # do, that we should either use [#fi-012] directly or re-write this
    # node as a thin curation around it. the code that used to be here
    # can be found under #tombstone-A.

    # (this normalization facility was tracked with :[#fi-037.5.F].)

    # THEN when we looked at the accompanying test file for this node,
    # we decided that its underpinning theory was so theoretically sound
    # (that the most important two features of "normalization" can be
    # modeled thru simple set theory); that those tests would make a good
    # foundation for tests testing these most important two features of our
    # "one ring" normalization.

# #tombstone-A: threw it all away
