# the meta-meta-properties justification [#088]

hopefully without needing to explain it here we know what "formal
properties" are and that they are useful. but if not, see [#022].

then, with formal properties understood, you should know what [#044]
meta-properties are before you move on.

so, meta-meta-properties are the *hardcoded* set of formal properties
available to you for describing your meta-properties.




## the meta-meta-properties

  • name
  • default
  • enum
  • required-ness



## analysis

because internally the class that models your properties and the class
that models your meta-properties is typically the same class, this is a
bit of a ruse: if none of this makes sense to you yet but you know what
formal properties are, then think of it this way: the above list is the
out-of-the-box recognized list of formal properties that you can use to
define your formal properties. that probably doesn't make sense either.
