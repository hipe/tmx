# interpretations to and expressions of an ACS [#083]



## context & scope

here we specify how both [#089] "compound" and "terminal" components of
an ACS typically handle input & output from and to various "modalities."
to be cheeky, we refer to input as "interpretation" and output as
"expression".




## "modalities"..

..is our catch-all term that refers broadly to "substrate" and
"encoding" when it comes to IO. for example, "JSON" is one modality.
there is a particular way that we "interpret from this modality, and a
particular way we "express to" it as well.




## what is a semi-formal definition for an ACS?

just so we agree on terms in this document,

  â€¢ here we conceive of an ACS as a directed graph, a tree,

      * with every child node having a name that is
        unique in the context of its parent

      * and that name (let's just say for now) is a name that
        isomorphs cleanly with the spec at [#013]:API.A,

      * ergo the root node has no name.

      * furthermore we'll conceive of the children of these
        nodes as being ordered.

      * nodes that have children have nothing but children, and nodes
        that have no children we've called a variety of things (e.g "field",
        "atom") but we'll call "leaf" for now.




## towards an interpretation API - unmarshaling

there exists a potentially limitless variety of ways that one component
for one ACS can be interpreted from the potentially limitless variety of
input "modalities". we will refer to the "thing" that does this
interpretation as an "interpreter", but we will offer no rigorous
specification for interpreters here.

it's worth comparing a [#089] "mutation session" to an interpreter - it
"feels like" the mutation session is acting as an interpretor for tenet
3 from there (thru which all compound components are presumably built in
a normal world). (however, internally it is the particular component class
itself that actually constructs a mutable component, before passing it off
to a mutation session which interprets the input.)




### :#note-JSON-A

we do this by interating over the *whole* formal structure first, and
then complaining about any remaining unparsed items second. rather, we
*could* give the formal structure a hash-like inteface somehow, and then
iterate over each element of the parsed JSON structure using this map -
the different would be that for serialized structures that do not occupy
every formal component, there would be less iteration. however, because
we don't have that hash-like interface we are sticking with this.




### :#note-REF-A

when the method index is in its beginning state, use the below hand-written
map-reduce to produce each next "entry"; all the while memo'ing each entry
produced for the one stream. if such a stream ever reaches its end, this
moves the index out of this beginning state: for subsequent requests we used
the cached array of entries.

the rationale behind this is that we don't want to index every node if we
don't have to (for example if we are seeking only one thing as opposed to
all things). (although the way we may do this now may not need this
stream anyway.)

the benefit of this is revealed by #coverage-1, which shows the cache
being used.

the worst case cost to this is if we were were repeatedly request a node
near the the end but never reach the end.
