# the skylab "brazen" sidesystem

## objective & scope

the "brazen" ([br]) sidesystem used to be the homeland for our application
framework-like code. the most prominent of such efforts and experiments
include the entity library and the "ACS", but these have now all moved to
their own dedicated or more closely affiliated sidesystems.

in more detail:

  • (used to house [#001] "entity" but that moved to [fi])

  • (used to house the ACS but that moved to its own lib)

  • (used to house [#ze-000] the "zerk" command-line utility framework)

what remains here at the moment is a deprecated "framework" (the last one)
and a lot of specialized CLI tools will wiil eventually assimliated to
somewhere else.

if there is any longterm utility for this sidesystem, it might be for the
suite of storage adapters it has.
