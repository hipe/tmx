    # what we're calling the "set difference features" of normalization are
    # those that can implemented with simple set theory, namely:
    #
    #   - unexpected ("extra") arguments
    #   - missing required associations
    #
    # in a theoretical if not practical sense, we can define how we derive
    # these using the language of set theory: the "extra arguments" set can
    # be derived as the relative complement of the expected set with respect
    # to the actual set; and the missing required arguments can be derived
    # as the relative complement of the actual arguments set with respect to
    # the required arguments set.
    #
    #     required âŠ† associations
    #
    #     unexpected = actual \ associations
    #     missing = required \ actual
    #
    # in plain language, we can say that unexpected arguments are those
    # arguments that are in the actual argument set that are not in the set
    # of known associations.
    #
    # missing required arguments are those arguments in the set of required
    # (formal) arguments that are not in the actual arguments.
    #
    # ([#ze-027] is another place where we use set theory.)
