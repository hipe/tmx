# numbering scheme

the first five files in this directory were assigned numbers on the
three's (01, 04, 07..) to leave some room to add a few semantically
nearby files in between them in the future.

the order they were given reflects the "feeling" of either how complex
they are (least complex first) or how "high-level" they are
(higher-level later). but, as these five nodes are independent of each
other, the order is largely cosmetic.
