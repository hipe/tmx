# meta-attributes :[#009]

# brief history

this used to be "the parameter narrative". it is one of the earliest
still-living strains of attribute library in this universe. see the
history appendix at the end of this file for interesting historical
milestones.






## :[#.C]

the order of the subsections of this section is from general to specific
in an abstract, perhaps arbitrary sense:

  • boolean can be conceived a special form of enum

  • the DSL modifiers are special forms of writers

  • defaulting and building are related in that they both need
    special processing by the client. for whatever reason they are
    seen as more general than the above, but more specific then writers.




## :[#.D]  (now a tombstone)

# #tombstone once had #storypoint-280 "worst thing i've ever done"
# #tombstone :[#.A] was an explanation of "meta-params"
# #tombstone :[#.B] was a definition of a formal parameter
# #tombstone "dogfood" :[#.E] "now we use our own hands to hit ourself with our own dogfood"
