# meta-attributes :[#009]

# brief history

this used to be "the parameter narrative". it is one of the earliest
still-living strains of attribute library in this universe. those
historical waypoints that we care to eulogize are listed contiguously
as tombstones in the last lines of this file.




## meta-attributes in general..

.. are attributes that describe attributes..




## these meta-attributes in particular..

.. represent a default set of meta-attributes that is available "out of
the box" by the relevant nodes of this library. they are distilled from
about five years of 13 different libraries that worked in a similar space
(but went about it in myriad ways).

  • older meta-attributes that are practically deprecated are
    commented as "ancient". (they are typically the ones that are also
    method definers, because typically meta-attributes that defined
    methods were used to define "DSL controllers" (once "joysticks"),
    something we no longer are interested in for whatever reason.)

  • these meta-properties (and perhaps others) if applied will,
    when processing user input, engage an extra step to effect
    the extra work for normalization they require:

      * `default`
      * `optional`

# #tombstone :[#.A] was an explanation of "meta-params"
# #tombstone :[#.B] was a definition of a formal parameter
