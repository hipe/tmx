# the parameter narrative :[#009]

## introduction

this is an ancient legacy library, transplanted at least once (from [hl]
to [fi]). this is one of the eariest parameter libraries.

included in this node is the "worst thing i've ever done",
at #storypoint-280. we intend to kill this with fire.

the fate of this node is discussed at [#001] "discussion of the [..]". be
sure to read that before investing in this at all. and then no matter what,
don't invest in this at all.


## :[#.A]  (was explanation of meta-params)



## :[#.B]
Experimentally let a formal parameter be defined as a name (symbol)
and an unordered set of zero or more properties, each defined as a
name-value pair (with Symbols for names, values as as-yet undefined.)
A parameter definition is always created in association with one host
(class or module), but in theory any existing parameter definition
should be able to be deep-copy applied over to to another host, or for
example a child class of a parent class that has parameter definitions.




## :[#.C]

the order of the subsections of this section is from general to specific
in an abstract, perhaps arbitrary sense:

  • boolean can be conceived a special form of enum

  • the DSL modifiers are special forms of writers

  • defaulting and building are related in that they both need
    special processing by the client. for whatever reason they are
    seen as more general than the above, but more specific then writers.




## :[#.D]  (now a tombstone)




## dogfood :[#.E]
