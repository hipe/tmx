digraph G {
 label="(from the documentation)
a failure graph with some complexity:
five atom nodes, three compound.

the nodes that have more than one depender
(there are two of them) are of interest:

G (a compound with multiple dependers)
must be mentioned multiple times but
must be descended into only once.

as for J (an atom with multiple dependers),
depending on the surface expression templates
it may or may not expose itself to a risk
of redundant expression of its predicate..
