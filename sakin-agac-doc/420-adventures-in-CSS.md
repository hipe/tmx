# adventures in CSS

(this article is a stub. i can help expand it.)

[John Earle's medium article][source1] was a good intro to the theory of

but then this [one by Karl Danninger][source2] had the advantage of
not needing an image to prove its proof of concept and also kind of
"feeling" cleaner (but we might jump back)..
