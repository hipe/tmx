# sakin agac

(bastardized for the nonsensical turkish "calm tree")




## objective & scope

mainly:
  - learn react.
  - experiment with unobtrusive static pages
  - do that one static thing with tables
  - do that one static pipeline with webpack

now, these ideas are expanded in [their own document][\[#403\]].
