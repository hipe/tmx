this is a temporary file with notes about this particular cluster
of items on our TODO stack. some entries here may contain text that
we'll use in the corresponding commits for the milestones.

the whole existence of this is a bit of sell or strain showing a
shortcoming of our project management approach .. food for thought
for much later.

after this paragraph it is written "upside down" to correspond with
its counterpart stack file.
