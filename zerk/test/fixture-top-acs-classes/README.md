this numbering scheme:

we give our namespace a capacity of 99: 01-99.

generally, we "hop along" at every three,
so 1, 4, 7.. (to leave 2 available interceding
spots to be filled after the initial
allotment of numbers). or sometimes not.

for consistency of filenames, all files have
"class" in the name; but any file may in fact
define at its toplevel a module instead, as
per what the test is testing.

the first 10 (1-10) are for ACS's composed of
a single sub-node only. (and if the sub-node is
compound, it must be the empty compound node
"dummy")

the next 30 (11-40) are for any ACS's that go
"wide" but not "deep", so none of these can
have compounds as children.

at writing the exitsing nodes here have been
placed "tightly" and in chronologesque order.

the next 30 (41-70) can go deep and wide
arbitrarily.

(71-99) are reserved for components re-used
to compose other components (but are not
tops themselves.)
