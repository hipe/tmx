# the asset contents (i.e code) of this node became so small that having
# its own file was no longer justified; but in such cases we keep these
# files around both for continuity with a possible future where the file
# is again needed, and to hold this note. what follows is the original
# comment explaining the node.

    # attempt to realize a zerk-compatible [ac] ACS as an "API", so that
    # its underlying operations can be invoked directly without needing to
    # go thru a UI.
    #
    # this is intended to be useful if you want to expose your zerk-assisted
    # application as a callable library.  this allows you (for example) to
    # test your application functionally by being able to invoke your
    # operations "more directly" without having the overhead, noise and
    # extra moving parts of a full UI.
