[#051]       now: the moving-target "operator branch" API, with at least
             three implementors. justification in document.

             the comprehensive manifest of implementors is:

               - 1x hash-based here
               - 1x for autoloaderized modules here
               - 1x currently spliced into [br]

             the generated messages convey the same information (less
