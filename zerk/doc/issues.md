[#066]       [ model re-use ]
             it's ghastly. although you could sub-class model actions,
             don't. doing so becomes a liability for the host application.
             only reuse those magnetics exposed as part of the
             microservice model's public API (and as such keep real logic
             out of the actions so it is exposed as potentially exposable
             but not interface-facing magnetics).
