# compound parse :[#053]

this is an EXPERIMENT for helping to implement what is THE CENTRAL reason
for existence for both [tmx] and "slowie"..

it's premised on the assumption that there's two "operation" *instances*
that will be complicit in the merge..

  - it is assumed that each operation instance cna produce a fixed list
    (stream) of normal symbols representing its fixed set of available
    primaries at this moment, the start of the post-operation-resolution
    parsing. (note, though, that at this one moment each operation can
    produce any list it wants).
