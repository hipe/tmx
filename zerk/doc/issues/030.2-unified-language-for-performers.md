## quick rundown of every detail of "actions" and "events" et. al

in a typical [br]-powered application, the following general points hold:

  • [br] applications exist to process requests. for each request, the
    kernel will by default navigate the application's tree-like "model"
    to try and resolve one "unbound action" that corresponds to the
    request, or (when one unbound action cannot be resolved) fail in
    some pluggable way.

  • an "unbound action" can be viewed as a function that accepts as
    arguments 1) the remainder of the request structure that wasn't
    processed by the above step, and 2) zero or one
    "selective event listener".

  • the "unbound action" may be a simple proc, or (more typically)
    a dedicated class. but ultimately it can be anything, provided that
    it has an interface that is among the set of recognized interfaces
    for a [br] unbound action.

  • in the common case that an unbound action is implemented as a
    decicated class, the class (by the hands of the kernel) will almost
    always produce exacty one instance per request, dedicated to fulfilling
    that request and that request alone. in such cases we refer to this
    instance as a "bound action" (in contrast to the "unbound action",
    which refers (in such cases) to class that made it).

  • a long-running action instance capable of processing multiple requests
    is something imagined but as yet not needed. it may be better to
    implement something like this through "shared resources", a point
    that brings us outside of our scope.

  • the result of this function-call-ish (either bound action or otherwise)
    against the input can be anything. whatever this final return result
    is of this "call", this is what the kernel will present as the final
    result of this request.

  • as well, it is common (although certainly not mandatory) that
    "potential events" are emitted during the course of this execution.
    it is tempting to thing of "events" as "side-effects" of the call,
    but given that they do not necessarily change state, they are more
    their own thing. but whether or not any potential events are emitted
    depends on the action. it is the "selective event listener"
    that will receive notifications of these potential events (if any).

  • typically this selective event listener will receive notification of
    "potential events" in the form of a "channel" and a function.
    typically the listener will look at the channel (or not) and decide
    whether or not, given the channel, it would like the event. if it
    would like it, it calls the function that was passed to it, whose
    job it is to produce the event object.

  • a "channel" is always isomorphic to a simple "tuple" or "list" of
    "symbols". if you prefer, you can think of a channel as an array
    of strings. different applications may use different idioms to
    dictate how they express potential events with channels, but
    typically the "topmost" component of this list of symbols is
    something like `error` or `info` (the sybols), to express in a
    pseudo-universal way something broadly semantic about the event.

  • typically this selective event listener, once it has decided that
    (given the channel) it wants the event, and once it has called the
    event-producing function, will take this event and pass it to some
    kind of top (a.k.a "modality") client that expresses the event in
    some way appropriate to the modality as determined by its adapters.
    but all of this is totally invisible to the "bound action".


## quick rundown of every detail of "models"

here are some points as we think of them, but these are just disjoint
thoughts for now:

  • we *always* model our business objects (if any) with classes, one
    class per formal business entity. such classes "live" in the "model"
    [tree] of your application. confusingly we also call each such class
    a "model" as well.

  • when dismbiguation is needed, we will use "model tree" to refer to
    the whole thing, and "model" to refer to one individual node.

  • in local jargon we refer to an instance of a model as an "entity".
    confusingly a popular and powerful library called "entity" is also
    used to enhance arbitrary classes, sometimes actions.

  • i.e., the "model" is the class; the "entity" is the instance.

  • we typically require that every action "live" under one such model.
    if your model calls for an action that does not fit naturally under
    a business model node, for now we accomplish the effect of this
    through a combination of a "promotion" and the use of business-eque
    dummy node called "front".

  • a "model" has zero or more "properties" and zero or more "actions".

  • a "model" acts like an unbound action (in fact one day we might etc)
    in that it receives requests and produces results. in this regard,
    however, a model's only job is to dispatch the request down to an
    appropriate child action of the model; it does not fulfill the
    request "directly" itself.

  • as one of its actions, a model can "have" another model node.
    in this way a model tree may be arbitrarily deeply nested.




## models and actions

we want to live in a world where we do not have to write the most
typical of actions for our data-driven applications. we want our
each action's behavior to emerge naturally from the model, specifically
the model's properties and (maybe one day) associations. but hold that
idea nearby but off to the side for now.

the action is where all the (er) action takes place. but surprisingly
we frequently find the action nodes the simplest of all of the three
categories of thing presented in this document.

why is that? it's because given the fundamental mandate of 'D.R.Y', the
bulk of ancillary logic required by a typical action frequently lives
elsewhere. why is *that*? [edit: figure out why]
