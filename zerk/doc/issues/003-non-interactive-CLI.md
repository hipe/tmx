# node maps and #mode-tweaking :[#046]

[ze]'s main thing is the *generation* of clients from an ACS; but [ze]
recognizes that it is not always optimal (or possible) to generate a client
purely by inferring one from an ACS.

:#mode-tweaking refers to the general act of customizing the client of your
application beyond what is generated by [ze]. the "mode" in #mode-tweaking
means "modality". currently this facility is being frontiered by (and only
exists in) CLI.



## general theory

the way you express a customization to an interface element is through
a "node map". (EDIT)






# disjoint notes

## #note-1

this took quite a long time to untangle, and it is still quite tangled.
this is terrible and needs a rewrite it's so confusing #todo:

we don't have to transfer all the stated values, only the
bespokes, because #spot1.4 does the appropriated values.

and now we have to pass thru the provisioned guys too,
but with no value so etc..

look at how we hack two parallel streams or whatever that is
