# about the taxonomy of the tests sibling to this file -

this node is for tests that test CLI integration for the original three
actions of "file metrics": line count, "ext", and "dirs".

for actions beyond those, we recommend that we put the modality-specific
tests under the appropriate reactive tree node. that is, now the gravity
for reactive tree node is stronger than the gravity for modality.

(but it makes sense to have the others near each other because of how
much code they share, on both the asset and testing ends.)
