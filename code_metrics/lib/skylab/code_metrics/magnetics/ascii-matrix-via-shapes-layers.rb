      # :[#007.E] vertical centering (& related) is a moving-target
      # micro-API. consider this an experimental version of it:
      #
      # the rectangular coordinates that accompany a label definition
      # correspond to the rectangular shape or area the label refers to.
      #
      # this is, they do *not* indicate the horizontal or vertical
      # span of space the label is meant to "fill" or "stretch" into.
      #
      # rather, the modality is on its own to decide the appropriate
      # positioning, clipping, truncation, horizontal stretching, and
      # (imaginarily) font & font size for the label as appropriate to
      # the modality and shape being labeled.

      # here in ASCII-land, that means these translational dynamics:
      #
      #   - for now we're not gonna mess with some novelty act like
      #     horizontal stretching (allÃ  `[[ i n c e p t i o n ]]`).
      #
      #   - likewise we're not even gonna think about a `banner` or
      #     `figlet` type external service..
      #
      # tricks like these are so out of scope that they would take
      # us backwards: by adding any such complexity they miss the point
      # entirely of the ASCII target (notwithstanding a change of our
      # would-be (non-written) mission statement).
      #
      # so for now it's always monospaced, letter-per-letter spacing.
      # in the other direction:
      #
      #   - because of the definitional axiom (that the label's rect *is*
      #     the rect being described), we would sometimes overprint the edge
      #     decoration of rectangles except that we take steps to avoid it
      #     :#here-2. (this workaround, in turn, will cause frustrating
      #     behavior if ever we label something other that rects (e.g empty
      #     space or an arc between them) but for now we don't..
      #
      #   - our implementation of "ellipsifying" strings that are too long
      #     is as crude as can be, but see comment above about "missing
      #     the point".
