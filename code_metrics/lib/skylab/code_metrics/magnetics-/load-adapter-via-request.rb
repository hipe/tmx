    # the "load adapter" is what the recording session uses to ensure that
    # all files of interest are loaded.
    #
    # our decision to insulate this through this faÃ§ade is informed by
    # experience: this is the third such would-be adapter. other efforts
    # have included a const-based "load ticket" as well as a single path
    # variant. (the latter is not in history, but is what brought us to the
    # ideas that led to the massive rearchitecting.)
    #
    # if ever we try to broaden this to general (non-[co]-autoloady) use,
    # such an adapter will be the means to do it by.
