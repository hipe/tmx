### "digraph" vs. "dot file"

generally we prefer "digraph" to "dot file" because the former sounds
more theoretical and the latter seems to relate more to our storage
substrate than our business model.

however, internally some of our performersneed to manipulate the document
at the sexp-level so at this point it is futile to try and abstract our
implementation away completely..
