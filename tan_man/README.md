# the skylab "tan-man" utility

## objective & scope

create and modify a dependency graph programmatically (currently one that
lives as a a graph-viz dotfile). this was one of the earliest attempts at
something resembling an application (alongside "tan-man").

tan-man was one of our first big attempts at something feeling like an
application.
