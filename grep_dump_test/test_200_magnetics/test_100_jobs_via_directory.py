    """(so...)

    all we are really doing here is writing unit tests to affirm behavior
    of a language feature/the standard library. BUT

    we want these tests to exist as a tracker on the behavior itself, so
    that we're notified (by way of test failure) if it ever changes BECAUSE

    it seems that part of the point of context managers is that it's a more
    readable alternative to wrapping things in try/except blocks and having
    `ensure` clauses. (it is.)

    insomuch as there's a "design pull" towards readability, the
    `@contextmanager` decorator seems to try and further this effort
    (making it ostensibly a compelling choice for most context managers) BUT

    as we discovered only after going "all in" with this approach, this
    technique has a serious shortcoming that the author feels should possibly
    warrant its removal form the stdlib:

    when you construct your context-managers using this technique, the
    would-be `__exit__` function is not guaranteed to be called as it is
    when using the class form. (perhaps it can be no other way).


    furthering the design pull of readability even more, the `@contextmanager`
    decorator allows such constructs to be even more concise. (you're in
    effect writing two code blocks with one.) HOWEVER, a thing we didn't know
    until we bumped into it is that [see note #here1 below].
